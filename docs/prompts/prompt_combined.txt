TASK: For the provided MD&A text, analyze each macro factor and produce a comprehensive sentiment assessment.

FACTORS TO ANALYZE:
- interest_rates: Interest rate environment and impact on business
- fx: Foreign currency exchange rate effects
- inflation: Inflationary pressures and pricing power
- competition: Competitive positioning and market dynamics
- supply_chain: Supply chain conditions and constraints
- regulation: Regulatory environment and compliance
- trade_policy: Trade policies, tariffs, and geopolitical factors

OUTPUT: JSON array where each object contains:
- factor: One of the factors listed above
- presence: Boolean indicating if factor is discussed
- aggregated_score: Float from -1.0 to +1.0
- sentiment_label: One of strongly_negative, negative, slightly_negative, neutral, slightly_positive, positive, strongly_positive
- sentences: Array of up to 3 most representative sentences
- confidence: Agent's confidence in assessment (low, medium, high)
- justification: Brief rationale for the score


SENTIMENT SCORING RUBRIC:
- +0.8 to +1.0 (strongly_positive): Explicit positive outlook. Keywords: "significant opportunity", "strong benefit", "favorable", "exceeded expectations".
- +0.4 to +0.7 (positive): Generally positive but less certain. Keywords: "expect to benefit", "could improve", "positive trend", "confident".
- +0.1 to +0.3 (slightly_positive): Acknowledges positive factor but minimal impact. Keywords: "modest improvement", "limited upside".
- 0.0 (neutral): Purely factual, no emotional language. Keywords: "remained stable", "unchanged", "immaterial effect".
- -0.1 to -0.3 (slightly_negative): Minimal negative impact. Keywords: "modest headwind", "minor pressure", "manageable".
- -0.4 to -0.7 (negative): Clear negative but not catastrophic. Keywords: "headwind", "unfavorable", "negatively impacted", "pressure", "challenging".
- -0.8 to -1.0 (strongly_negative): Explicit severe risk. Keywords: "materially adverse", "significant downturn", "severe risk", "critical threat".


INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze ALL factors, even if not explicitly mentioned (set presence=false, aggregated_score=0.0 for absent factors).
- For each factor, find the most representative sentences and compute an aggregated sentiment score.
- Consider context and qualifiers when scoring (e.g., "could" vs "will", "modest" vs "significant").
- If a factor has mixed sentiment, note this in the justification and explain the aggregation.
