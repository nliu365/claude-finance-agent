TASK: Identify sentences with mixed sentiment (both positive and negative elements) in the MD&A text.
Split complex sentences into sub-statements where possible and score each component.

OUTPUT: JSON array of objects with the following fields:
- original_sentence: The full sentence containing mixed sentiment
- sub_statements: Array of objects, each with:
  - text: The sub-statement text
  - sentiment_score: Float from -1.0 to +1.0
  - sentiment_label: One of strongly_negative, negative, slightly_negative, neutral, slightly_positive, positive, strongly_positive
  - is_positive: Boolean indicating if this sub-statement is positive
- aggregated_score: Weighted average of sub-statement scores
- aggregation_method: "mean" or "weighted_by_length"
- justification: Explanation of how the aggregated score was derived
- provenance: Optional object with paragraph_index, char_start, char_end

MIXED SENTIMENT INDICATORS:
- Conjunctions: "but", "however", "although", "despite", "while", "on the other hand"
- Contrast patterns: "increased... offset by", "growth in... decline in", "benefited... impacted by"
- Hedge words: "partially", "somewhat", "to some extent", "largely offset"

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Focus on sentences that contain both positive and negative sentiment elements.
- Use clause boundaries (commas, semicolons, conjunctions) to split sub-statements.
- Weight sub-statements by importance or length when computing aggregated score.
- Return at most 5 items; prioritize the most clearly mixed sentences.
- If no mixed sentiment sentences found, return an empty array.
