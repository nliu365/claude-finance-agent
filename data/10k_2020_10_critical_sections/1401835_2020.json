    "section_1": "ITEM 1.BUSINESS.\nCorporate Background\nThe Company was originally incorporated on December 8, 2006, under the laws of the State of Nevada as Elan Development, Inc. On April 25, 2008, the name of the company was changed to Star Gold Corp. Star Gold Corp. is a pre-development stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of precious metal deposit properties and advancing them toward production. The Company is engaged in the business of exploring, evaluating and acquiring mineral prospects with the potential for economic deposits of precious and base metals.\nStar Gold Corp. currently leases with an option to acquire certain unpatented mining claims located in the State of Nevada which in part make up what we refer to as the \u201cLongstreet Property\u201d (or the \u201cLongstreet Project\u201d). The Longstreet Property in its entirety comprises 125 mineral claims: 75 original optioned claims, of which 70 are unpatented staked claims and five claims leased from local ranchers, pursuant to the \u201cClifford Lease\u201d; as well as 50 claims subsequently staked by Star Gold. The Longstreet Property covers a total area of approximately 2,500 acres (1,012 ha). The Longstreet Project is at an intermediate stage of exploration.\nThe Company has no patents, licenses, franchises or concessions which are considered by the Company to be of importance. The business is not of a seasonal nature. Because minerals are traded in the open market, the Company has little to no control over the competitive conditions in the industry.\nOverview of Mineral Exploration and Current Operations\nStar Gold Corp. is an exploration stage mineral company with no producing mines. Mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product. The Company acquires properties which it believes have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals, particularly gold and silver. These acquisitions have and may take the form of unpatented mining claims on federal land, or leasing claims, or private property owned by others. An unpatented mining claim is an interest, that can be acquired, in the mineral rights on open lands of the federally owned public domain. Claims are staked in accordance with the Mining Law of 1872, recorded with the federal government pursuant to laws and regulations established by the Bureau of Land Management. The Company intends to remain in the business of exploring for mining properties that have the potential to produce gold, silver, base metals and other commodities.\nThe Company will perform basic geological work to identify specific drill targets on the properties, and then collect subsurface samples by drilling to confirm the presence of mineralization (the presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation). The Company may enter joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration and/or development work. It is the Company\u2019s plan to focus on assembling a high-quality group of mid-stage mineral (primarily gold and silver) exploration prospects, using the experience and contacts of the management group. By such prospects, the Company means properties that have been previously identified by third parties, (including prior owners and/or exploration companies), as mineral prospects with potential for economic mineralization. Often these properties have been sampled, mapped and sometimes drilled, usually with indefinite results. Accordingly, such acquired projects will have either prior exploration history or will have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore deposit model. Geographic emphasis will be placed on the western United States.\nThe geologic potential and ore deposit models have been defined and specific drill targets identified the Company\u2019s sole remaining property. The Company\u2019s property evaluation process involves using basic geologic fieldwork to perform an initial evaluation of a property. If the evaluation is positive, the Company seeks to acquire, either by staking unpatented mining claims on open public domain, or by leasing the property from the owner of private property or the owner of unpatented claims. Once acquired, the Company then typically makes a more detailed evaluation of the property. This detailed evaluation involves expenditures for exploration work which may include rock and soil sampling, geologic mapping, geophysics, trenching, drilling or other means to determine if economic mineralization is present on a property.\nof 54\nPortions of the Company\u2019s mining properties are owned by third parties and leased to Star Gold as outlined in the following table:\n(1)Great Basin Resources, Inc. (\u201cGreat Basin\u201d) took assignment from MinQuest, Inc., of the 142 claims which are leased to the Company under the Longstreet Agreement (which was also assigned to Great Basin) (Note 4 of the financial statements contained in Item 8) and Clifford owns 5 claims (also Note 4) which are managed by the Company.\n(2)On August 12, 2019, the Company and Great Basin Resources, Inc. (\u201cGreat Basin\u201d) agreed to amend the Longstreet Agreement (Note 4) to eliminate the required property expenditure structure and to implement new consideration for the transfer of the Property pursuant to that agreement (the \u201c2019 Amendment\u201d). The Amendment eliminated the remainder of the required property expenditures set forth in the Longstreet Agreement, as amended.\nCompliance with Government Regulations\nContinuing to acquire and explore mineral properties in the State of Nevada will require the Company to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the State of Nevada and the United States Federal agencies.\nUnited States\nMining in the State of Nevada is subject to federal, state and local law. Three types of laws are of particular importance to the Company\u2019s U.S. mineral properties: those affecting land ownership and mining rights; those regulating mining operations; and those dealing with the environment.\nLand Ownership and Mining Rights.\nOn Federal Lands, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872 (General Mining Law) as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 21-161 (various sections), which allows the location of mining claims on certain Federal Lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and proper compliance with claim location requirements. A valid mining claim provides the holder with the right to conduct mining operations for the removal of locatable minerals, subject to compliance with the General Mining Law and Nevada state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims, as well as compliance with various federal, state and local operating and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances. As the owner or lessee of the unpatented mining claims, the Company has the right to conduct mining operations on the lands subject to the prior procurement of required operating permits and approvals, compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable mining lease, and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances.\nMining Operations\nThe exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws.\nThe State of Nevada likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can begin, although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication of permitting efforts. Among other things, a detailed reclamation plan must be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until that time. The Nevada Department of Environmental Protection, which is referred to as the NDEP, is the state agency that administers the reclamation permits, mine permits and related closure plans on the Nevada property. Local jurisdictions (such as Eureka County) may also impose permitting requirements (such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals).\nof 54\nEnvironmental Law\nThe development, operation, closure, and reclamation of mining projects in the United States requires numerous notifications, permits, authorizations, and public agency decisions. Compliance with environmental and related laws and regulations requires us to obtain permits issued by regulatory agencies, and to file various reports and keep records of the Company\u2019s operations. Certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to a public review process during which opposition to the Company\u2019s proposed operations may be encountered. The Company is currently operating under various permits for activities connected to mineral exploration, reclamation, and environmental considerations. Unless and until a mineral resource is proved, it is unlikely Star Gold Corp. operations will move beyond the exploration stage. If in the future the Company decides to proceed beyond exploration, there will be numerous notifications, permit applications, and other decisions to be addressed at that time.\nCompetition\nStar Gold Corp. competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties and for equipment and labor related to exploration and development of mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom the Company competes have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact Star Gold Corp.\u2019s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its mineral properties.\nThe Company provides no assurance it will be able to compete in any of its business areas effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and operating results.\nOffice and Other Facilities\nStar Gold Corp. currently maintains its administrative offices at 1875 N. Lakeview Drive, Suite 200 Coeur d\u2019Alene, ID 83814. The telephone number is (208) 664-5066. Star Gold Corp. does not currently own title to any real property.\nEmployees\nThe Company has no employees as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Star Gold Corp. conducts business largely through independent contractor agreements with consultants.\nResearch and Development Expenditures\nThe Company has not incurred any research expenditures since incorporation.\nReports to Security Holders\nThe Registrant does not issue annual or quarterly reports to security holders other than the annual Form 10-K and quarterly Forms 10-Q as electronically filed with the SEC. Electronically filed reports may be accessed at www.sec.gov\nITEM 1A.",
    "section_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause the actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K or presented elsewhere from time to time.\nEstimates of mineralized material are forward-looking statements inherently subject to error. Although resource estimates require a high degree of assurance in the underlying data when the estimates are made, unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors can have significant adverse or positive impacts on the estimates. Actual results may inherently differ from estimates. The unforeseen and uncontrollable factors include but are not limited to: geologic uncertainties including inherent sample variability, metal price fluctuations, variations in mining and processing parameters, and adverse changes in environmental or mining laws and regulations. The timing and effects of variances from estimated values cannot be accurately predicted.\nFailure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations, and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. Star Gold Corp. cannot assure readers that the Company will successfully address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect its business.\nof 54\nRisks Related to the Company\nThe Company has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of the business and prospects\nThe Company has not derived any revenue from exploration of its properties. The Company\u2019s operating history has been limited to the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. Such history does not provide a meaningful basis for an evaluation of its prospects for success if future determinations are made that mineral reserves exist and to commence construction and operation of a mine. Other than through conventional and typical exploration methods and procedures, the Company has no additional means to evaluate the likelihood of whether its mineral property contains any mineral reserve or, if they do, that it will be operated successfully. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating costs without realizing any operating revenues during the period it explores existing and any future acquired properties.\nDuring the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020, the Company had a net loss of $454,850 in connection with the maintenance and exploration of its mineral properties and the operation of the exploration business. The Company therefore expects to continue to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. The Company recognizes that if it is unable to generate significant revenues from mining operations and dispositions of its properties, the Company will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. At this early stage of operations, the Company expects to face the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies at the development stage of their business. The Company cannot ensure it will be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties and the failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that the Company will prove successful and the Company can provide investors no assurance that we will generate any operating revenue or ever achieve profitable operations.\nInvestors\u2019 interests in the Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share if the Company issues additional employee/director/consultant options or if the Company sells additional shares to finance its operation.\nThe Company has not generated any operational revenues from the exploration of any properties. In order to further expand the Company\u2019s business and meet its objectives, including but not limited to, obtaining funds to further explore the Company\u2019s existing properties or to finance any acquisition activity, growth and/or additional exploration programs, should those opportunities present themselves, and depending on the outcome of its exploration programs, additional capital funding may need to be obtained through the sale and issuance of additional equity, debt or derivative securities. The Company may also, in the future, grant to some or all of its directors, officers, insiders and key employees/consultants, options or other rights to acquire common or preferred shares in the Company as non-cash incentives. The issuance of any additional equity securities could cause then-existing stockholders to experience dilution of their ownership interests.\nShould the Company issue additional shares to finance its business activities, investors\u2019 interests in the Company may be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. As of the date of the filing of this report there are outstanding 29,039,849 common share purchase warrants exercisable into 29,039,849 shares of common stock, and 7,145,000 options granted that are exercisable into 7,145,000 shares of common stock. If these are exercised or converted, these would represent approximately 31.9% of the Company\u2019s then issued and outstanding shares. If all the warrants and options are exercised and the underlying shares issued, such issuance would cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders. The dilution may result in a decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s shares.\nConflicts of interest\nCertain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors may be or become associated with other businesses, including natural resource companies that acquire interests in properties. Such associations may give rise to conflicts of interests from time to time. The Company\u2019s directors are required by law to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the Company\u2019s best interests and to disclose any interest, which they may have in any of the Company\u2019s projects or opportunities. In general, if a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of the board of directors, any director in a conflict will disclose his interest and abstain from voting on such matter or, if he does vote, his vote will not be counted.\nof 54\nDependence on Key Management Personnel\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue exploration and development activities and to develop a competitive edge in the marketplace depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and maintain qualified key management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain such personnel. The Company\u2019s development now, and in the future, will depend on the effort of key executives such as Lindsay Gorrill, Kelly Stopher, and David Segelov. The loss of any of these key people could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the Company has expanded the provisions of its stock option plan so the Company can provide incentive for the key personnel.\nFailure to obtain additional financing\nUnless and until the Company can generate revenues from operations, the Company\u2019s main potential continuing source of funds will be additional debt and/or equity financings which may not be sufficient to sustain operations. There is no guarantee that the Company, if needed, will be able to raise additional funds through debt and/or equity financing or that any such financing will be able to be obtained on terms beneficial to the Company. If Star Gold Corp. is unsuccessful in raising additional funds, the Company will not be able to develop its properties and may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nCompany Directors and Officers own 26,857,167 shares of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock (34.7%) which may cause corporate decisions influenced by the Directors and Officers to appear to be inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders.\nCompany directors and/or officers as a group control a combined 34.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Accordingly, while none of the current directors and/or officers (individually or collectively) can control, as shareholders, who is elected to the board of directors, since these individuals are not simply passive investors but are also active members of Company management, their interests as directors and/or officers and shareholders may, at times, be adverse to those interests of merely passive investors. Where those conflicts exist, stockholders will be dependent upon management exercising their fiduciary duties as members of the Board of Directors and/or as an officer. Also, due to their stock ownership position, members of the Company\u2019s management team will have: (i) the ability to substantially influence the outcome of many (if not most) corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including amendments to the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation; and (ii) the ability to substantially influence corporate combinations or similar transactions that might benefit minority stockholders which may not be supported by management to the detriment of smaller and/or passive investors.\nThere is substantial risk that no commercially viable mineral deposits will be found due to speculative nature of mineral exploration,\nExploration for commercially viable mineral deposits is a speculative venture involving substantial risk. Star Gold cannot provide investors with assurance that any of its mining claim contains commercially viable mineral deposits. The exploration program that the Company will conduct on its claim may not result in the discovery of commercially viable mineral deposits. Problems such as unusual and unexpected rock formations and other conditions are involved in mineral exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. In such a case, the Company may be unable to complete its business plan and investors could lose their entire investment.\nDue to the inherent dangers involved in mineral exploration, there is a risk that the Company may incur liability or damages as it conducts its business.\nThe search for minerals involves numerous hazards. As a result, Star Gold Corp. may become subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which the Company cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. Star Gold Corp. currently has no such insurance nor does the Company expect to acquire such insurance for the foreseeable future. If a hazard were to occur, the costs of rectifying the hazard may exceed the Company\u2019s asset value and cause management to liquidate all the Company\u2019s assets resulting in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s entire investment.\nExploration efforts may be adversely affected by metals price volatility causing the Company to cease exploration efforts.\nThe Company has no earnings from operations. However, the success of any exploration effort is derived from the price of metals which are affected by numerous factors including: 1) expectations for inflation; 2) investor speculative activities: 3) relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies; 4) global and regional demand and production; 5) global and regional political and economic conditions; and 6) production costs in major producing regions. These factors are beyond the Company\u2019s control and are impossible for the Company to accurately predict.\nThere is no guarantee that current favorable prices for metals and other commodities will be sustained. If the market prices for these commodities fall the Company may suspend or cease exploration efforts.\nof 54\nGovernmental regulation and environmental risks\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing mining exploration, development, production, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, use of toxic substances, environmental regulations, mine safety and other matters. New legislation and regulations may be adopted at any time that results in additional operating expense, capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the exploration, mining, production or development of its properties\nPermitting and Studies\nThe Company is subject to governmental requirements related to permitting and preparation of various studies related to the impact of mining projects on the flora, fauna, the environment and physical areas in and around the area proposed to be mined. There are no guarantees that any studies, the Company is required to prepare, will be favorable to the Company\u2019s intent to mine any project it develops, nor are there any guarantees that the Company will receive all, or any, of the permits needed for it to mine any project it develops.\nInternal control, fraud detection and financial reporting\nShould the Company fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, it may not be able to detect fraud or report financial results accurately, which could harm the business and could subject the Company to regulatory scrutiny.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d), the Company is required to perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. The Company is not required to have an independent registered public accounting firm test and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of such internal controls and publicly attest to such evaluation. Continuing compliance with the requirements of Section 404 is expected to be expensive and time-consuming. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm the Company\u2019s operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations.\nRisks Associated with the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nStar Gold Corp. stock is a penny stock; stockholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their stock.\nThe shares of Star Gold Corp. common stock constitute \u201cpenny stocks\u201d under the Exchange Act. The shares will remain classified as a penny stock for the foreseeable future. The classification as a penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker/dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his or her investment. Any broker/dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares will be subject to rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Exchange Act. Rather than having to comply with these rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell a penny stock.\nThe \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted by the SEC under the Exchange Act subjects the sale of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to certain regulations which impose sales practice requirements on broker/dealers. For example, brokers/dealers selling such securities must, prior to effecting the transaction, provide their customers with a document that discloses the risks of investing in such securities.\nLegal remedies, which may be available to an investor in \u201cpenny stocks,\u201d are as follows:\na)if \u201cpenny stock\u201d is sold to an investor in violation of his or her rights listed above, or other federal or states securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel his or her purchase and get his or her money back.\nb)if the stocks are sold in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms that caused the fraud for damages\nc)if the investor has signed an arbitration agreement, however, he or she may have to pursue his or her claims through arbitration.\nof 54\nIf the person purchasing the securities is someone other than an accredited investor or an established customer of the broker/dealer, the broker/dealer must also approve the potential customer\u2019s account by obtaining information concerning the customer\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. The broker/dealer must also decide whether the transaction is suitable for the customer and whether the customer has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be reasonably expected to be capable of evaluating the risk of transactions in such securities. Accordingly, the SEC\u2019s rules may limit the number of potential purchasers of the shares of Star Gold Corp. common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has been volatile and stockholder investment in the Company\u2019s common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is quoted via the OTC Markets. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. These factors include price fluctuations of precious metals, government regulations, disputes regarding mining claims, broad stock market fluctuations and economic conditions in the United States.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is currently quoted via the OTC Markets, there are no assurances any public market for the Company\u2019s common stock will continue. There are also no assurances as to the depth or liquidity of any such market or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares. An investment in these shares may be totally illiquid and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment readily or at all when they need or desire to sell.\nThe Company does not intend to pay any dividends on shares of common stock in the near future.\nThe Company does not currently anticipate declaring and paying dividends to its stockholders in the near future, and any future decision as to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon the Company\u2019s earnings, financial position, capital requirements, plans for expansion and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant. It is the Company\u2019s intention to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to finance the growth and development of the business.\nITEM 1B.",

The Company believes this office space and facilities are sufficient to meet the Company\u2019s present needs, and do not anticipate any difficulty securing alternative or additional space, as needed, on terms acceptable to the Company.\nThe Company currently does not own any real property. The Company owns a vehicle for business use in Nevada and other personal property used in the conduct of the Company\u2019s business at its headquarters and at its various holdings in Nevada.\nThe Company is an exploration stage company with no proven or measured mineral reserves. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists at the Longstreet Property. Further exploration will be required before any final determination as to the economic or legal feasibility may be made as to the Company\u2019s property.\nTHE LONGSTREET PROPERTY\nIn January of 2010 Star Gold signed an agreement (the \u201cLongstreet Agreement\u201d) to lease with an option to acquire from MinQuest, Inc. (\u201cMinQuest\u201d), 60 unpatented mining claims totaling approximately 490 hectares. The Company completed its first phase of drilling in 2011. On July 9, 2010, the Company and MinQuest entered into an amended agreement to add an additional 10 claims and expanded the total to 70 unpatented claims. In addition, Star Gold agreed to reimburse MinQuest for 5 claims leased from a third party, Roy Clifford. The Longstreet Property comprises 125 mineral claims (75 original optioned claims, of which 70 are unpatented staked claims and five claims acquired from local ranchers (Roy Clifford et al)), as well as 50 claims subsequently staked by Star Gold, covering a total area of approximately 2,500 acres (1,012 ha) (Figure 6-1). The claims are located within Sections 9-17, 20, and 21 of T6N, R47E, MDB&M (Mount Diablo Base Line & Meridian), Nye County.

The fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 annual claim payments totaled $23,824.\nOn December 4, 2018, the Company amended the Longstreet Agreement to change the due date of certain expenditures required by that agreement (the \u201c2018 Amendment\u201d). The 2018 Amendment extended the due date of the 2019 expenditures from January 16, 2019 to August 31, 2019 and also extended the due date of the 2020 expenditures from January 16, 2020 to August 31, 2020. No other provisions of the Longstreet Agreement, as previously amended, were affected by the 2018 Amendment.\nOn August 12, 2019, the Company and Great Basin agreed to amend the Longstreet Agreement (the \u201c2019 Amendment\u201d) to eliminate the required property expenditure structure and to implement new consideration for the transfer of the Longstreet Property pursuant to that agreement. The 2019 Amendment eliminated the remainder of the required property expenditures. The 2019 Amendment sets forth Great Basin to transfer title of the Longstreet Property to the Company upon the Company:\na)Adjusting the exercise price to $0.04 on 435,000 existing options to purchase Company common stock from exercise prices ranging from $0.05 to $0.08 per share;\nb)issuing an additional 500,000 options to purchase Company common stock at the exercise price of $0.04;\nc)making a cash payment of $50,000 to Great Basin (paid on August 19, 2019) and\nd)entering into a consulting agreement with Great Basin with a term of eighteen months.\nOn August 12, 2019, the Company repriced 435,000 existing options to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock to an exercise price of $0.04 and issued an additional 500,000 options to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock at an exercise price of $0.04. The fair value of the re-pricing and issuance of additional stock options was $16,044 which was capitalized as \u201cMining Interest\u201d.\nOn September 1, 2019, the Company executed a consulting agreement with Great Basin for a term of eighteen (18) months (the (\u201cConsulting Agreement\u201d). Under the Consulting Agreement, the Company will pay Great Basin $7,500 per month for the term of the Consulting Agreement.\nThe Longstreet project is located 48 kilometers southeast of the Round Mountain Mine in Nevada. Longstreet is a Round Mountain style volcanic-hosted gold deposit. The first vein mapping program ever done at Longstreet was completed in October 2002. This work disclosed that gold-bearing veins at Main, as well as 6 other targets in the project area are steeply dipping. Most of the previous drilling was vertical. This indicates high potential to increase continuity, tonnage and grade of the resource. Surface geochemical sampling of veins from all the currently defined targets found gold values up to 18.1 g/t. As at Round Mountain the property contains strong potential for both open pit heap-leachable and high-grade millable ore. No party reading this report should conclude the Longstreet property has economic mineralization due to Longstreet\u2019s proximity to Round Mountain. Comparison to this and other historic or producing mines is strictly informational relative to location and similar geologic characteristics.\nHistory: The Longstreet Property was discovered in the early 1900\u2019s but had limited development work until 1929. A 1929 report and maps show development of the \u201cGolden Lion Mine\u201d on two levels spaced 75 meters apart vertically. The report indicates development of 300,000 tons of \u201cvein material\u201d averaging 0.20 oz/ton (6.8 g/t) gold and 8 oz/ton (274 g/t) silver. A mill was constructed, the remnants of which are still on the property. However, the small stopes underground indicate very little mining was done and the operation was abandoned.\nThe property lay idle until 1980 when Keradamex Inc. and E & B Exploration formed a joint venture to explore the property. The venture conducted soil and rock chip geochemical surveys, limited underground sampling and drilled seven angle core holes (one was abandoned) into the Main mine workings area. This drilling revealed the presence of fracture related gold mineralization up to 36 meters thick extending into the hanging wall of the vein structure. In 1982 Minerva Exploration optioned the property and initiated an underground sampling program. In 1983 a joint venture was formed with Geomex Canada Resources Ltd. and Derry, Michener, and Booth were commissioned to assess the property and conducted underground sampling, bulk sampling and metallurgical testing.\nof 54\nof 54\nIn 1982 Minerva Exploration optioned the property and initiated an underground sampling program. In 1983 a joint venture was formed with Geomex Canada Resources Ltd. Derry, Michener, and Booth were commissioned to assess the property and conducted underground sampling, bulk sampling and metallurgical testing.\nIn early 1984 Naneco Resources Ltd., an Alberta company, acquired all of the assets of Minerva and an additional 10 percent interest in the property from Geomex. As operator, Naneco immediately initiated drilling. In 1985, with over 200 RC holes drilled the venture announced encouraging results with anomalous grades of gold and silver throughout its drilling samples.\nDuring the next few years Naneco increased its interest from 53 percent to 100 percent, conducted additional metallurgy, economic evaluation and drilling. At least 492 RC holes were drilled, most within the Main resource area. Unable to raise money because of falling gold prices and strapped with high land payments to the claim owners, Naneco relinquished the property in 1998. MinQuest acquired it shortly thereafter. The Cyprus target, which was evaluated by Cyprus Minerals Company in 1987 was acquired by MinQuest in early 2002.\nThe property was optioned to Rare Earth Metals Corp. (REM) in May of 2002. REM later changed its name to Harvest Gold. Mapping and geochemical sampling of the 7 targets shown on the attached map was completed in October 2002. From 2003 through 2005 REM drilled 30 holes into Main totaling 3,350 meters. The drill holes were angled toward the intersection of the two primary sheeted vein sets. Results showed a 20% improvement in average grade over vertical drilling.\nFollowing the split of REM into Harvest Gold and VMS Ventures, Inc. Harvest performed no further work at Longstreet after late 2005. The property was finally returned to MinQuest in August 2009. By agreement with Minquest, on January 15, 2010 Star Gold Corp. received an option to acquire the portions of the property covered by the option.\nStar Gold began drilling in the fall of 2011. A 16-hole program at Main showed new intercepts at depth in the central portion of the deposit. Intercept thicknesses of +0.01 oz./ton gold equivalent values are 65 to 120 feet. Of the 16 holes drilled 8 have +100 feet thicknesses of +0.01 oz./ton gold equivalent and 4 have +200 feet thicknesses of +0.01 oz./ton gold equivalent. Drill hole LS-1101 has 305 feet of +0.01 oz./ton gold equivalent. Gold equivalent values were derived from the following formula: AuEq oz./ton = Au oz./ton + (Ag oz./ton)/60. Drilling results are shown in the table below.\nDrill samples were sent through a rotating, wet sample splitter attached to the drill to reduce the sample volume and maintain a representative sample. Drill helpers, under the supervision of the project geologist, collected and bagged an \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 sample on 5-foot intervals. Procedurally, an \u2018A\u2019 sample is collected and held by the project geologist for security purposes until it can be delivered to an assay facility. The \u2018B\u2019 sample then remains on site as a duplicate or backup sample if needed at a later date. A blank and two known \u2019standard\u2019 pulps are then submitted randomly spaced with each drill hole. Once assays are available, they are examined for unexpected high or low values. If unexpected high or low values are encountered, the \u2018B\u2019 splits may be collected and submitted, or the lab may be requested to re-assay the pulp or reject in question. The \u2018check\u2019 samples and \u2019standard\u2019 are examined to insure they agree with the original or know within accepted limits, usually +/- 10%.\nALS Chemex of Reno, Nevada did all sample preparation, including crushing, grinding and preparation of the assay pulps. The samples were never left unattended or unsecured by project geologist, drilling or laboratory staff nor are they handled by officers, directors or associates of Star Gold.\nSample preparation involves crushing the entire sample to -10 mesh, splitting, then pulverizing 1,000 grams to 75% passing 75-micron mesh. These pulps are then transferred within the ALS Chemex facility for assay. Both gold and silver assays are done by fire assay with an AA finish. The standard Star Gold-Longstreet submittal to ALS Chemex requests a 30-gram charge for gold fire assay. Assays which exceed 10 g/ton are automatically subjected to a gravimetric finish. Select sample intervals, usually those near intervals assaying significant gold, are chosen by the project geologist for re-assay also.\nThe Longstreet Project is affiliated with a paleo-hot springs system in a caldera associated volcanic setting very similar to the Round Mountain mine. Round Mountain is an open pit, heap-leach mine that has produced over 10 million ounces of gold over a 30-year period with the average grade currently being mined of 0.018 oz./ton gold. Cut-off grades for Round Mountain and several other oxide ore heap leach operations in Nevada range from 0.003 to 0.005 oz./ton gold. Star Gold hopes to develop an open pit, bulk minable, heap leachable gold/silver mine at Longstreet.\nNo party reading this report should conclude the Longstreet property has economic mineralization due to Longstreet\u2019s proximity to any historic or producing mines and any information regarding any such historic or producing mines is strictly informational relative to location and similar geologic characteristics.\nof 54\nRegional Geology and Mineralization: The Longstreet Property is located in the Nevada portion of the Basin and Range Province. This geological province is characterized by repeated episodes of compressional deformation in Paleozoic and Mesozoic time followed by extensional deformation and extensive magmatism and volcanism in Cenozoic time. Gold deposits are most often described as being associated with \u2018mineralization trends\u2019 that reflect deep crustal structures and magmatism, such as the \u2018Walker Lane\u2019 and the \u2018Carlin Trend\u2019. The Longstreet Project is in the Monitor Range, adjacent to the northwest trending Walker Lane volcanic-hosted gold trend that includes such world-class deposits as the Comstock and Goldfields mining camps\nof 54\nThe Monitor Range is a westward-tilted fault block that has been elevated by normal faults along its eastern front and is typical of the uplifted mountains of the Basin and Range Province. The ranges are topographic highs rising above alluvium-filled valleys generated by Tertiary extensional tectonics. Central Nevada was an area of intense Oligocene - Miocene ash-flow volcanism that created numerous calderas and their outflow products. At least 13 calderas that range in age between 32 and 22 Ma have been mapped or interpreted in the area extending from the Shoshone Mountains eastward to the Monitor Range. The southern Monitor Range consists Mainly of Tertiary age volcanic and hypabyssal rocks related to the eruption of the Big Ten Peak volcano and a nearby unnamed 29 Ma caldera (Kleinhampl and Ziony, 1985) intruding and overlying Paleozoic sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.\nThe Paleozoic rocks are thrust-faulted marine sedimentary rocks comprised of quartzite, argillite and limestone of Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian age. Minor amounts of Permian marine sediments are also present in the Georges Canyon area.\nIn the southern Monitor Range Tertiary age volcanic rocks comprise more than 90% of the exposed bedrock. These rocks are more than 1 km thick and are predominantly flat lying. Early Oligocene to early Miocene rhyolitic to dacitic ash-flow tuffs, with rhyolitic welded tuff are the thickest and most extensive units. Most of the Tertiary intrusions in the region are rhyolitic, but several small dacitic to andesitic dikes are present in the Georges Canyon area.\nMineral deposits in this part of the Basin and Range Province are varied and widespread and some of them have (had) substantial metal production. The producing Round Mountain gold deposit is about 25 miles northwest, and the past-producing Manhattan Mining Camp (gold/silver) is about 20 miles west-northwest of the Longstreet Property.\nThe Round Mountain Mine is a giant among epithermal precious metal deposits hosted by volcanic rocks, and the mineralization is a classic example of low sulphidation epithermal gold mineralization (White and Hedenquist, 1995). Gold deposits were discovered at Round Mountain in 1906 (Shawe, 1982) and by 1959 about 410 thousand ounces (troy ounces) of gold had been produced from placer and narrow vein lode deposits. Current production by open-pit mining methods commenced in 1977. Kinross (2010) reported an annual production for 2010 at 184,554 ounces of AuEq, with over 66 million tons of proven and probable reserves.\nThe oxidized ore is described as a closely spaced set of steeply dipping veins and veinlets following northwest-trending faults and associated joints over broad areas. Significant gold mineralization is not found in northeast-trending faults and fractures. The vein/veinlet system contains quartz, adularia, limonite (oxidized from pyrite), manganese oxide and associated native free gold. Flat veins are similar to the steep veins in character and mineral content, but with more brecciation of the wall rocks. Gold contents also appear to be higher in the flat veins. The adularia in the ore related veins is dated at 25.9 to 26.6 Ma, which is indistinguishable from the age of the enclosing \u2018Tuffs of Round Mountain\u2019 welded ash flow tuffs. These tuffs were erupted from the Round Mountain caldera and were deposited within the caldera (Henry, Castor and Elson, 1996).\nNo party reading this report should conclude the Longstreet Property has economic mineralization due to Longstreet\u2019s proximity to any historic or producing mines and any information regarding any such historic or producing mines is strictly informational relative to location and similar geologic characteristics.\nHydrothermal alteration associated with the bulk mineable ore is evidenced by silicification and the replacement of magmatic feldspar by hydrothermal feldspar engendered by a potassium-rich hydrothermal fluid (Sander, 1988).\nof 54\nThe Manhattan gold / silver camp is located approximately 20 miles west-northwest of the Longstreet Project and is an example of Tertiary epithermal mineralization superimposed on Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Gold / silver deposits were discovered at Manhattan in 1905 (Shawe, 1982) and by 1959 about 10,500 kg of gold and 4,400 kg of silver had been produced from placer and lode deposits. The lode deposits in the Manhattan district are of a variety of types, although they occur together in a coherent belt about 1 km wide, which follows the south side of the Manhattan caldera for about 10 km. The most productive deposits formed in strongly faulted argillite and quartzite of the Cambrian age Gold Hill Formation. The generally north-trending zones of mineralized fractures are stockworks containing quartz, adularia, pyrite (oxidized to limonite) and native gold similar to the sheeted zones at Round Mountain. The silver production recorded for this camp is related to electrum and various silver-bearing sulphosalts.\nThe Clipper Mine located approximately 5 miles southwest of the Longstreet Mine near Murphy Camp was discovered in 1903 and was worked intermittently until 1943. The mine was initially developed during World War I and included a 175-foot shaft and a 370-foot adit. Recorded production is about $12,000 (in 1951dollars) from mineralization having a gold to silver ratio of 1:1 and assaying from $34-124 per ton (1951 dollars). Host rocks are welded rhyolite ash-flow tuffs similar to the Longstreet mine. The Little Joe Claim located 6 miles south-southwest of the Longstreet Mine was developed by a 75-foot inclined shaft. Gold-bearing veins in \u2018rhyolitic tuff\u2019 were mined but production details are lacking.\nAt an un-named mine, located 1.5 miles west of the mouth of Georges Canyon irregular gold / silver quartz veins and veinlets containing minor pyrite were exploited from a 25-foot inclined shaft. The vein system occurs in possible Paleozoic light gray chert and silicified argillite along a fault. No production details are available.\nMineralization on the Last Chance claims located 11 miles west-northwest of the Longstreet Project and southwest of Big Ten Peak was discovered in the 1920s. Mineralization consists of argentiferous galena, minor sphalerite and pyrite occurring in irregular pipes and chimneys generally at the intersection of cross faults within a northwest-trending shear zone in pre-Tertiary rocks. This property was developed by a 30 m two compartment shaft and a 61 m adit. Production in the late 1920s is recorded as 13.6 tons containing an average of 720 g/t Ag, 21% Pb and 2% Zn. A further 18.1 tons produced in 1938 contained 240-275 g/t Ag and 8% Pb.\nMetallurgy: 2013 Metallurgical Test Program\nThe 2013 metallurgical test work program was conducted by McLelland Laboratories under the direction of a QP metallurgical engineer contracted by Star Gold. The program included bottle roll tests, column tests and comminution tests and mineralogical examination.\nSection Sample Assays\nA total of 65 underground adit samples weighing 816 pounds (370kg) and three surface samples weighing 904 pounds (410kg) were collected for metallurgical testing. Each of these samples were crushed to 100% -2 inches (50mm) and assayed for gold and silver in duplicate. Assay results are listed in Table 8.2. Samples were combined to generate surface and underground composites, as well as a blended master composite. Triplicate direct assays were conducted on each composite. Standard deviations between triplicate head assays were high, particularly for the surface master composite. The agreement between the triplicate splits was not good, however the average of the triplicate assays is close to what was expected, based on the section assays. It was noted that the quality control samples all checked out as well, which indicates that the assays are good and the gold occurrence in the potentially economic mineralization is just a little \u201cspotty\u201d.\n.1 Gold Head Assays and Head Grade Comparisons\nA total of twenty pieces of rock from both underground and surface were selected for comminution testing. The remainder of the samples were separately stage crushed to 100% -2-inches (-50mm). Each of the underground and surface samples were then blended to form a master composite representing both the underground and surface samples. The blended sample was then split to generate a third master composite. Samples were collected for bottle roll tests. All composites were then further crushed to 80% -3/4 inch (19mm), blended, then split into 75kg lots for column testing. Selection sample assay results and detailed blending procedures are provided in the Appendix to this report.\nBottle Roll Testing\nA bottle roll test was conducted on each of the three composites at an 80% -10 Mesh (1.7mm) feed size to determine lime requirements for column leach testing. Gold and silver recoveries were similar for all three composites. Gold recoveries ranged from 80.6% to 81.9% and silver recoveries ranged from 17.5% to 20.0%.\nAdditional bottle roll tests, at a cyanide concentration of 1.0g NaCN/L were conducted on the blended master composite at feed sizes of 100% -2 inches (50mm), 80% -3/4 inches (19mm) and 80% -1/4 inch (6.3mm) to determine sensitivity to feed size. The blended master composite showed a moderate sensitivity to feed size with respect to gold and silver recovery. Recovery was 18.4% higher for gold, and 13.9% higher for silver, at a feed size of 80% -1/16 inches (1.7mm) than at a feed size of 100% -2 inches (50mm).\nof 54\nSilver recovery, for each bottle roll test conducted, was low. In order to investigate the cause of the low silver recovery, three additional bottle roll tests were conducted on the blended master composite to determine response to increased cyanide concentration (5.0g NaCN/L) at typical heap leach (80% -3/4 inches, 80% -1/4 inches) and milled (80% -200 Mesh (75\u00b5m)) feed sizes.\nResults showed that increasing the cyanide concentration did not significantly increase silver recovery at heap leach feed sizes, however, silver recovery increased substantially when feed was finely ground. Silver recovery was 60.6% from the bottle roll test conducted on 80% -200 mesh material. Gold recovery was also moderately higher when fine grinding was employed. Mineralogical analysis of head and tail samples of the blended master composite confirm that the primary reason for low silver recovery is due to the very fine-grained nature of the silver sulfide, which when exposed, is readily leachable. The silver leach rate at 200 mesh was extremely fast. Silver recovery was complete within the first two hours, which suggests that the silver mineralization is very fast leaching once liberated. In contrast, silver-bearing jarosites tend to be refractory and are usually unaffected by leaching regardless of the grind size.\nSummary results from bottle roll testing are given in Table 8.3. Detailed bottle roll test data including leach rate figures, are provided in the attached spreadsheet.\nBottle Roll Test Results, 2013\nBoth gold and silver recoveries are slightly improved with increased crush size, the increase in recovery is more pronounced in the silver as compared to gold when a fine grind is applied. Figure 8.3 illustrates this. It is important to keep in mind that in order to reduce the particle size to 80 % passing 75 microns a conventional comminution circuit employing crushing and grinding would be required.\nof 54\nColumn Leach Testing\nColumn leach test were conducted on each of the master composites, utilizing a feed size of 80% -3/4 inch (19 mm) in order to determine gold and silver recoveries, recovery rates and reagent requirements under simulated heap leach conditions. Lime additions were based on bottle roll tests. Test columns were sized at 15 cm diameter by 3 meters high using PVC piping with material stacked in the leaching columns in a manner in which to minimize particle segregation and compaction. Leaching was conducted by applying a cyanide solution of 1.0g NACN/L over the charge at a feed rate of 12 Lph/m2 of column cross sectional area. After leaching, freshwater rinsing was conducted to remove residual cyanide and to recover dissolved gold and silver values.\nDetail column leach tests data, including screen analysis of the feed and tails and drain down rates can be found in the Appendix, identified as McLelland Report No. 3829 titled Heap Leach Cyanidation Testing Longstreet Project, dated April 6, 2014.\nAll three composites were leached for 190 days. Gold and silver extractions for the surface master composite (SMC) reached 88.9 % and 20.0 %, respectively. Gold and silver extraction for the underground master composites (UMC) was 84.6 % for gold and 15.4 % for silver. The master blend composite (MBC) achieved gold and silver recoveries of 86.3 and 16.7 respectively. Summary results from column leach testing are provided in Table 8.4. Detailed results, including leach rate figures are provided in the Appendix.\nSummary Metallurgical Test Results\nRecovery results by size fraction for all three master composites indicates that finer crushing would not substantially improve gold recovery. Gold recovery was similar throughout the various size fractions with only a slightly elevated recovery in the finest size fraction (-75 microns). Silver recovery on the other hand would benefit from a finer particle size and would require fine grinding in order to maximize recovery.\nOverall metallurgical results indicate that the Longstreet master composites are readily amenable to simulated heap leach treatment at 80 % -19 mm feed size. Gold recoveries for all three composites were similar and ranged from 84.6 % to 88.9 % in 190 days of leaching and rinsing. Silver recoveries were similar for all three samples, with recoveries ranging from 15.4 % to 20.0%.\nIt is important to note that although the column tests were conducted over a period of 190 days, gold extraction was essentially completed in the first 30 days of leaching. Silver leach rates, on the other hand, were very slow and it is not expected that they would improve beyond the 190-day cycle.\nCyanide consumption rates were high and ranged from 1.56 to 1.93 kg NaCN/t of ore. This was due in part to the long leach times. Cyanide consumption rates in a commercial operation are typically much lower.\nof 54\nFigures 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 diagrammatically illustrate the leach rates and results for gold and silver.\nFigure 8.4 Surface Master composite leach kinetics\nFigure 8.5 Underground master composite leach kinetics\nof 54\nFigure 8.6 Master blend composite leach kinetics\nProperty Geology: Geologic mapping by MinQuest since 2002 indicates that the majority of the Longstreet Project is underlain by moderately to poorly welded rhyolite ash-flow tuff (\u2018Tat\u2019) containing conspicuous exotic lithic fragments and pumice (Figures 5, 7, 8 and 9). The ash-flow tuff unit is buff to gray, and contains <10% quartz phenocrysts, 15% feldspar phenocrysts, 5-15% pumice and 5-20% other exotic fragments in an aphanitic groundmass (Liedtke, 1984). Hydrothermal alteration is prevalent and consists of argillic (bleaching and clay mineral development), silicic (pervasive silica flooding, or extremely high veinlet density) and potassic (adularia in quartz veinlets). Limonite and geothite development are considered to be weathering phenomena. These felsic ash-flow tuffs of Oligocene age are similar in age and character to the \u2018tuffs of Round Mountain\u2019, which host the Round Mountain Mine.\nThe Tat tuff unit (see Figures 7, 8 and 9) displays horizontal bedding and may be in the order of 3,000 feet thick. The ash-flow tuff is intruded by rhyolite porphyry dykes (\u2018Trp\u2019) exhibiting various orientations and may represent feeder conduits to now-eroded rhyolitic lithologies higher in the stratigraphy.\nA thin discontinuous unit of volcaniclastic and siliceous sediments (\u2018Ts\u2019), including sinter is deposited upon the ash-flow tuff unit. The unit is white, yellowish and light gray, bedded in part and probably represents a hiatus in volcanism. Siliceous alteration resulting in the development of sheeted quartz vein systems affects the Tat, Ts and Trp rock units.\nOverlying the Tat tuff and the Ts sediments is a black to brown strongly welded ash-flow tuff (\u2018Trt\u2019) that forms bluffs and caps ridges. This unit has a distinctive thin (about 10 feet) vitrophyre zone near its base. This unit is estimated to be 300 to 450 feet thick and possibly a correlative of the Saulsbury Wash Formation (21.6 +/- 0.6 Ma).\nThe tectonic fabric on the Longstreet Project includes two Main directions of faulting/fracturing that have an influence on the mineralization. An east-trending steeply north-dipping system of fractures and faults has been noted at five of the seven gold / silver zones on the Property (see Figure 6). Quartz -adularia - limonite veins / veinlets and \u2018rusty fractures\u2019 following this trend contain gold mineralization. The other important gold / silver-bearing fault/fracture direction is 300-330\u00b0 with steep north dips and is characterized by sheeted quartz veins / veinlets and \u2018rusty fractures. The vein / veinlets also contain adularia and iron oxide minerals derived from the oxidation of sulfide minerals. This mineralized trend occurs at all seven of the gold / silver zones known on the Longstreet Project. Major displacement is not a feature of these structures.\nThe Longstreet project is an example of gold / silver mineralization related to east-trending structures. An east-tending fault dipping 40-55\u00b0 is associated with the highest-grade gold / silver mineralization known to date. The bulk of the gold / silver mineralization in the Longstreet Mine is contained in steeply dipping multiple vein sets in the hanging wall of the fault.\nLiedtke (1984) indicates that similar fault directions are known 4,600 feet south and 2,800 feet north of the Longstreet Project, which may host similar high-grade gold / silver mineralization.\nTargets: A short description of the 7 currently identified drilling targets at Longstreet follows:\nMain- The target consists of intersecting high-angle NW and E-W sheeted vein systems. Completion of an angle drilling program to the southwest perpendicular to the intersection of the two vein sets will continue to produce improved continuity and higher tonnage and grade. Un-drilled extensions of this mineralization are indicated to the southeast and west.\nof 54\nNE Main: Approximately 450m N-NE of the Main resource there is a poorly exposed, un-drilled target that looks identical to Main. Sampling of surface veins at NE Main reveal anomalous gold values.\nOpal Ridge: This is an erosional remnant of a sinter apron that once covered a much larger area. Extensions of the Main resource are down-dropped approximately 60m with an apparent displacement to the north of less than 10m. E-W and NW high level opal-rich veins are exposed in the lower portion of the apron with anomalous gold values. Although there may be a higher stripping ratio here, more of the deposit may be preserved.\nNorth: This is a sheeted vein system with identical vein attitudes to Main. Values up to 18.1 ppm Au indicate a strong system, although vein density appears to be less than at Main. The western end of the target has the strongest exposed mineralization.\nCyprus Ridge Zone: Quartz veins up to 5 m thick occur in this 1.1 km long northwest trending sheeted vein system. Cyprus Minerals Company completed a 920 m drill program in 1987. All of the Cyprus holes were vertical or high angle and none tested the large primary vein set. No high-grade gold was intersected in their drilling. MinQuest mapped the intricate vein system in 2002 and collected 41 surface samples that contained anomalous to highly anomalous (several times background to hundreds of times background) veins. Due to the abundance of low temperature silica, MinQuest concluded that the gold values are leakage anomalies from a deeper boiling zone. The boiling zone is a high priority drill target.\nRed Knob Zone: Mineralization outcrops as northwest trending sheeted quartz-adularia veins over an area 150m wide by 300m long. Surface sampling found anomalous gold values. In addition, a boulder field on the north side of the target contains quartz-adularia veins up to 1m in thickness in an area of no outcrop. Drill intercepts from two holes testing a small portion of the target revealed anomalous gold values.\nSpire: This is an E-W vertical to steeply north dipping sheeted vein system. Intersecting NW trending veins are present but are much less abundant than at Main. Surface sampling at Spire had detected anomalous gold values.\nStar Gold\u2019s geologists believe sampling and drilling results to date warrant optimism of one or more economic, near surface, bulk-mineable, heap leach-recoverable gold-silver deposits at the Longstreet Project targets described above. In addition, sampling at surface near the Cyprus target suggests the presence of higher-grade veins, which may be suitable to underground mining methods. Situated on a high ridge-top, it could be easily mined from a canyon elevation adit.\nEnvironmental, plan of operation and reclamation: To the Company\u2019s knowledge, there is no known surface disturbance or groundwater contamination from previous mining activities. Remediation activities are performed immediately after completion of exploratory drilling. With respect to historical mining activities, there is no indication of reclamation at this time and, therefore, the Company has no plans to remediate. The Longstreet Property is within Forest Service lands and Star Gold has applied for and received a Plan of Operation from the Forest Service allowing exploration drilling. A surface disturbance bond of $89,400 has been paid and is held by the Forest Service until reclamation is completed. There are no other significant environmental requirements.\nITEM 3.",

    "section_7": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nPLAN OF OPERATION\nThe Company maintains a corporate office in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho. This is the primary administrative office for the Company and is utilized by Board Chairman Lindsay Gorrill and Chief Financial Officer Kelly Stopher.\nDuring 2019, the Company re-examined the costing assumptions of potentially building a leach pad near the Main nob and what the resultant economics would emerge from such a plan. That re-examination showed that moving the leach pad to 300 feet from the main knob of the Longstreet Project would limit land disturbance and result in reduced construction and hauling costs.\nIn September 2019, the Company received a positive decision on its application for a Drill permit from the BLM. This allows the Company to commence drilling mainly for the Hydrology study but also enabling drilling on other holes on the Main nob for geochemical analysis. A bond has been lodged and there are no impediments to drilling other than capital constraints. This decision is valid for two years and may be extended.\nFor the upcoming fiscal year ending April 30, 2021, the Company plans to commence the following activities as it prepares the EIS on the Longstreet Project:\nHydrology Drilling - 2 to 4 holes expected to be sufficient\nGeochemical analysis - design of program for submission to State of Nevada involves some core drilling;\nPlan of Operations Development (Mine Plan, Civil Engineering Designs)\nAssuming the results of the above-referenced studies are favorable, the Company intends to proceed to the preparation of an EIS and plan of operation for the Longstreet project (the \u201cLongstreet Plan\u201d). The eventual objective of the EIS and Longstreet Plan is the issuance, by each governing agency, of the necessary mine permits to authorize the construction of, and ongoing operations at, an open pit/heap leach mine at the Longstreet Property.\nApproval of the Longstreet Plan is subject to governmental agency review and may require additional remediation activities.\nManagement believes it can source additional capital in the investment markets in the coming months and years. The Company may also consider other sources of funding, including potential mergers, sale of property, joint ventures and/or farm-out a portion of its exploration properties.\nFuture liquidity and capital requirements depend on many factors including timing, cost and progress of the Company\u2019s exploration efforts. The Company will consider additional public offerings, private placement, mergers or debt instruments.\nAdditional financing will be required in the future to complete all necessary steps to apply for a final permit. Although the Company believes it will be able to source additional financing there are no guarantees any needed financing will be available at the time needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional financing when necessary, it may have to delay exploration efforts or property acquisitions or be forced to cease operations. Collaborative arrangements may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its mining claims.\nManagement believes it can source additional capital in the investment markets in the coming months and years.

If the Company is unable to raise additional financing when necessary, it may have to delay exploration efforts or property acquisitions or be forced to cease operations. Collaborative arrangements may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its mining claims.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company earned no operating revenue in 2020 or 2019 and does not anticipate earning any operating revenues in the foreseeable future. Star Gold Corp. is an exploration stage company and presently is seeking other natural resources related business opportunities.\nThe Company will continue to focus its capital and resources toward exploration and permitting activities at its Longstreet Property.\nTotal net loss for 2020 of $434,850 increased by $119,146 from 2019 total net loss of $335,704.\nMineral exploration expense\nMineral exploration expense for the year end April 30, 2020 was $25,244, an increase of $3,947 from 2019 exploration and consultants\u2019 expense of $21,297. The Company\u2019s emphasis has shifted from exploratory drilling to activities related to pre-development expense including environmental and anthropological studies associated with building a Plan of Operations and obtaining a permit for construct a mine at the Longstreet site.\nPre-development expense\nPre-development expense for the year ended April 30, 2020 was $155,716, an increase of $35,741 from 2019 pre-development expense of $119,975.\nTechnical consultant expense increased in 2020 due to a consulting contract executed with Great Basin Resources, Inc. as consideration for amending the Longstreet Property Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Great Basin will provide consulting and geologic expertise for a period of 18 months at a monthly rate of $7,500 per month until February 2021.\nOn November 4, 2019, the United States Department of Agriculture-Forest Service approved the Company\u2019s Longstreet Exploration Project which includes drilling of two test holes for water and a monitoring well to determine sufficient water supply for a potential mine at the Longstreet site.\nThe Company is currently assembling bids from engineering firms for development of a full Plan of Operations and Mine Schedule for development and eventual submission of an application to permit construction of a heap leach mining operation on the Longstreet property. The Company is also soliciting bids for drilling of monitor and water-course wells on the Longstreet property site to determine suitability for future mining and leach pad operations.\nof 54\nLegal and professional fees\nAudit and accounting fees increased $2,033 from $26,255 for the year end April 30, 2019 compared to $28,288 for the year ended April 30, 2020. Management expects audit and accounting fees to remain relatively constant in the upcoming fiscal year.\nThe primary component of public company expense is the annual fee associated with OTC Markets for the Company\u2019s OTCQB status. Public company expense increased $4,204 for the year ended April 30, 2020. The Company engaged an outside consultant for advisory services during the year ended April 30, 2020 which accounted for the bulk of the increase in public company expense for the year.\nInvestor relation expense of $13,288 for the year ended April 30, 2020 decreased $6,774 compared to $20,062 for the year ended April 30, 2019 as the Company engaged an investor relations consultant to build awareness in 2019.\nLegal fees increased from $9,488 in 2019 to $14,613 in 2020. The increase in legal fees for year ended April 30, 2020 is primarily as the result of non-recurring expenses related to preparation of contracts and documentation for the Longstreet Property Option Agreement Amendment (Note 4 to the Financial Statements contained in Item 8). There are no pending legal issues or contingencies as of April 30, 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nTotal general and administrative expense increased $72,828 to $193,808 compared to 2019 expense of $120,980.\nThe primary difference was attributable to the increase in management fees and payroll of $84,337 for the year ended April 30, 2020. In September 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors determined certain officers and directors should be compensated for their time and expertise. The Company accrued $109,000 of management fees for certain officers and directors as compensation for services as of April 30, 2020. During the year ended April 30, 2019, certain officers and directors were not compensated for their work.\nAuto and travel expense decreased for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2020 by $13,148. Travel is generally related to meetings associated with capital raises and visits to the exploration site by Company management and potential financiers.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in global exposure. COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the world. The World outbreak of COVID-19 has not, to date, had any material negative effects on the Company and/or its operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nof 54\nWorking capital will be utilized for the Company\u2019s ongoing environmental studies at its Longstreet Project scheduled for the summer of 2019 and general corporate purposes.\nThe Company utilized $62,000 in cash from Investing Activities to exercise its option on claims agreements and utilized for certain capitalized mineral assets at its Longstreet Project. The Company intends to continue exploration activities at Longstreet upon completion of environmental studies and permitting.\nAs of April 30, 2020, the Company had cash on hand of $26,617. Since inception, the sole source of financing has been sales of the Company\u2019s debt and equity securities. Star Gold Corp. has not attained profitable operations and its ability to pursue any future plan of operation is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing.\nStar Gold Corp. anticipates continuing to rely on sales of its debt and/or equity securities in order to continue to fund ongoing operations. Issuances of additional shares of common stock may result in dilution to the Company\u2019s existing stockholders. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete any additional sales of equity securities or that it will be able arrange for other financing to fund its planned business activities.\nThe Company\u2019s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, or ultimately to attain profitability. Potential sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include additional external debt, the sale of shares of the Company\u2019s stock or alternative methods such as mergers or sale of the Company\u2019s assets. No assurances can be given, however, that the Company will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash. The Company currently requires additional cash funding from outside sources to sustain existing operations and to meet current obligations and ongoing capital requirements.\nThe Company plans for the long-term continuation as a going concern include financing future operations through sales of our equity and/or debt securities and the anticipated profitable exploitation of the Company\u2019s mining properties. These plans may also, at some future point, include the formation of mining joint ventures with senior mining company partners on specific mineral properties whereby the joint venture partner would provide the necessary financing in return for equity in the property.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to its stockholders.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company has identified certain accounting policies, described below, that are most important to the portrayal of its current financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to the audited financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nAsset Impairments\nSignificant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties are capitalized. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s mineral properties for impairment is based on market conditions for minerals, underlying mineralized material associated with the properties, and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale. If no mineable ore body is discovered, or market conditions for minerals deteriorate, there is the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties.\nMineral Interests\nExploration costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. The Company capitalizes costs for acquiring and leasing mineral properties and expenses costs to maintain mineral rights as incurred. Should a property reach the production stage, these capitalized costs would be amortized using the units-of-production method based on periodic estimates of ore reserves. Mineral interests are periodically assessed for impairment of value, and any subsequent losses are charged to operations at the time of impairment. If a property is abandoned or sold, its capitalized costs are charged to operations.\nITEM 7A.",

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has negative working capital and accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) was initially incorporated as Elan Development, Inc., in the State of Nevada on December 8, 2006. The Company was originally organized to explore mineral properties in British Columbia, Canada but the Company is currently focusing on gold, silver and other base metal-bearing properties in Nevada.\nThe Company\u2019s core business consists of assembling and/or acquiring land packages and mining claims the Company believes have potential mining reserves, and expending capital to explore these claims by drilling, and performing geophysical work or other exploration work deemed necessary. The business is a high-risk business as there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s exploration work will ultimately discover or produce any economically viable minerals.\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThis summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company\u2019s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGoing Concern\nAs shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred operating losses since inception. As of April 30, 2020, the Company has limited financial resources with which to achieve the objectives and obtain profitability and positive cash flows. As shown in the accompanying balance sheets and statements of operations, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $11,157,593 and, at April 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s working capital deficit was $66,512. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Individuals to whom deferred compensation has accrued have agreed to forego payment until sufficient cash is available for payment of the liability (Note 7). On March 10 and June 25, 2020, respectively, the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board of Directors loaned the Company $50,000 and $30,000, respectively, which provides the Company liquidity to meet short-term financial obligations (Note 7). Achievement of the Company\u2019s objectives will be dependent upon the ability to obtain additional financing, to locate profitable mining properties and generate revenue from current and planned business operations, and control costs. The Company plans to fund its future operations by joint venturing or obtaining additional financing from investors and/or lenders.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to long-lived asset impairments and stock-based compensation valuation. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s reported financial position and results of operations.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological and other risks associated with operating an emerging exploration mining business, including the potential risk of business failure.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.\nof 54\nSTAR GOLD CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2020\nReclamation bond\nThe Reclamation bond constitutes cash held as collateral for the faithful performance of the bond securing exploration permits and are accounted for on a cost basis.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and reclamation bond. All instruments are accounted for on a cost basis, which, due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at April 30, 2020.\nFair Value Measures\nWhen required to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used. The Company determines the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. The categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 uses significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 uses significant unobservable inputs. The amount of the total gains or losses for the period are included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date.\nAt April 30, 2020 and April 30, 2019, the Company had no assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis.\nMining Interests and Mineral Exploration Expenditures\nExploration costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. The Company capitalizes costs for acquiring and leasing mining properties and expenses costs to maintain mineral rights as incurred. Should a property reach the production stage, capitalized costs would be amortized using the units-of-production method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves. Mining interests are periodically assessed for impairment of value, and any subsequent losses are charged to operations at the time of impairment. If a property is abandoned or sold, its capitalized costs are charged to operations.\nPre-development Expenditures\nPre-development activities involve costs incurred in the exploration stage that may ultimately benefit production which are expensed due to the lack of evidence of economic development which is necessary to demonstrate future recoverability of these costs.\nEquipment\nEquipment is stated at cost. Significant improvements are capitalized and depreciated. Depreciation of equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Gains or losses on disposition or retirement of property and equipment are recognized in operating expenses.\nReclamation and Remediation\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to standards for mine reclamation that have been established by various governmental agencies. In the period in which the Company incurs a contractual obligation for the retirement of tangible long-lived assets, the Company will record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability. A corresponding asset will also be recorded and depreciated over the life of the asset. After the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation, the liability will be adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. To date, the Company has not incurred any contractual obligation requiring recording either a liability or associated asset.\nof 54\nSTAR GOLD CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2020\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets to determine if any events or changes in circumstances have transpired which indicate that the carrying value of its assets may not be recoverable. The Company determines impairment by comparing the undiscounted net future cash flows estimated to be generated by its assets to their respective carrying amounts. If impairment is deemed to exist, the assets will be written down to fair value.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company estimates the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the Black-Scholes model, which requires the input of some subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (\u201cexpected life\u201d), the estimated volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock price over the expected term (\u201cvolatility\u201d), employee forfeiture rate, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation. Options granted have a ten-year maximum term and varying vesting periods as determined by the Board of Directors. The value of shares of common stock awards is determined based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of the award.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. The liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of (i) temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their basis for tax purposes and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when management concludes that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period.\nThe Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon its evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, our policy is to record the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit will be recognized in the financial statements.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the 2019 financial statements in order to conform to the 2020 presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on net loss, total assets or accumulated deficit as previously reported.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU No. 2018-07 expands the scope of the standard for stock-based compensation to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. ASU No. 2018-07 became effective for the Company on May 1, 2019. Adoption of this update on May 1, 2019 had no impact on the Company\u2019s financial statement.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The update removes, modifies and makes additions to the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this update on fair value measurement disclosures.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nof 54\nSTAR GOLD CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2020\nNOTE 3 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic Earnings Per Share (\u201cEPS\u201d) is computed as net income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options and warrants.\nThe outstanding securities at April 30, 2020 and 2019, that could have a dilutive effect are as follows:\nFor the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the effect of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock options and warrants would have been anti-dilutive and so are excluded in the diluted EPS.\nNOTE 4 - EQUIPMENT AND MINING INTEREST\nThe following is a summary of the Company\u2019s equipment and mining interest at April 30, 2020 and 2019.\nPursuant to the Longstreet Property Option Agreement with Great Basin Resources, Inc. (\u201cGreat Basin\u201d), as amended, which was originally entered into by the Company on or about January 15, 2010 (the \u201cLongstreet Agreement\u201d), the Company leases, with an option to acquire, unpatented mining claims located in the State of Nevada known as the Longstreet Property. Through August 12, 2019, the Company was required to make minimal lease payments in the form of cash and options to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOn December 4, 2018, the Company amended the Longstreet Agreement to change the due date of certain expenditures required by that agreement (the \u201c2018 Amendment\u201d). The 2018 Amendment extended the due date of the 2019 expenditures from January 16, 2019 to August 31, 2019 and also extended the due date of the 2020 expenditures from January 16, 2020 to August 31, 2020. No other provisions of the Longstreet Agreement, as previously amended, were affected by the 2018 Amendment.\nOn August 12, 2019, the Company and Great Basin agreed to amend the Longstreet Agreement (the \u201c2019 Amendment\u201d) to eliminate the required property expenditure structure and to implement new consideration for the transfer of the Longstreet Property pursuant to that agreement. The 2019 Amendment eliminated the remainder of the required property expenditures. The 2019 Amendment sets forth Great Basin to transfer title of the Longstreet Property to the Company upon the Company:\na)Adjusting the exercise price to $0.04 on 435,000 existing options to purchase Company common stock from exercise prices ranging from $0.05 to $0.08 per share;\nb)issuing an additional 500,000 options to purchase Company common stock at the exercise price of $0.04;\nc)making a cash payment of $50,000 to Great Basin (paid on August 19, 2019) and\nd)entering into a consulting agreement with Great Basin with a term of eighteen months.\nof 54\nSTAR GOLD CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2020\nOn August 12, 2019, the Company repriced 435,000 existing options to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock to an exercise price of $0.04 and issued an additional 500,000 options to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock at an exercise price of $0.04. The fair value of the re-pricing and issuance of additional stock options was $16,044 which was capitalized as \u201cMining Interest\u201d.\nOn September 1, 2019, the Company executed a consulting agreement with Great Basin for a term of eighteen months (the (\u201cConsulting Agreement\u201d). Under the Consulting Agreement, the Company will pay Great Basin $7,500 per month for the term of the Consulting Agreement. The Company paid Great Basin $60,000 for the year ended April 30, 2020. The payments to Great Basin are included in \u201cPre-development expense\u201d on the statement of operations. As of April 30, 2020, the remaining commitment to Great Basin is ten monthly installments of $7,500 each for a total of $75,000.\nThe 2019 Amendment also grants the Company the option, to be exercised no later than six (6) months following the first receipt of proceeds from the sale of ore from the Longstreet Property, to purchase one-half of Great Basin\u2019s 3.0% Net Smelter Royalty on the Longstreet Project for a payment of $1,750,000.\nNo other provisions of the Longstreet Agreement, as previously amended, were affected by the 2019 Amendment.\nIn addition, the Company is obligated, pursuant to the Longstreet Agreement, to pay an annual advance royalty payment of $12,000 related to the Clifford claims. For the year ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the Company paid the annual $12,000 advance royalty for additional mining interest on the Longstreet Property.\nOn September 20, 2019, the Company paid $67,800 to the United States Forest Service to increase the Reclamation Bond as collateral on the Longstreet Property. The bond is collateral on reclamation of planned drilling activities on the Longstreet Property and is refundable subject to the Company completing defined reclamation actions upon completion of drilling.\nNOTE 5 - OTHER ASSETS\nOn December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an Option and Lease of Water Rights with Stone Cabin Company, LLC (the \u201cStone Cabin Water Rights Agreement\u201d). In exchange for a one-time payment of $20,000, the Stone Cabin Water Rights Agreement granted the Company a three-year option to commence a ten-year lease of certain water rights in Nevada. The water rights are for use in conjunction with the Company\u2019s Longstreet Project. Lease payments for the water rights do not commence unless the Company exercises the option to lease. The Stone Cabin Water Rights Agreement also granted the Company the ability to extend, upon additional annual payments, the option to lease for up to an additional three years and the ability to extend the water rights lease (if exercised) for an additional ten-year period. The initial $20,000 payment was deferred and was being amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year option period ending December 31, 2019.\nOn December 31, 2019, the Company exercised its first option to extend the Stone Cabin Water Rights agreement for an additional twelve months and made a $20,000 payment. The $20,000 payment was deferred as \u201cOther Currents Assets\u201d and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the subsequent one-year option period. The Company retains the right to exercise two additional options to extend the Stone Cabin Water Rights Agreement, upon annual payments of $20,000 each.\nOn August 21, 2017, the Company entered into an Option and Lease of Water Rights, with High Test Hay, LLC (the \u201cHigh Test Water Rights Agreement\u201d). In exchange for a one-time payment of $25,000, the High Test Water Rights Agreement grants the Company a three-year option to commence a ten-year lease on certain water rights in Nevada. The water rights are for use in conjunction with the Company\u2019s Longstreet Project. Lease payments for the water rights do not commence unless and until the Company exercises the option to lease. The High Test Water Rights Agreement also grants the Company the ability to extend, upon additional option payments, the option to lease for up to an additional three years and the ability to extend the water rights lease (if exercised) for up to an additional twenty years. The $25,000 payment has been deferred and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year option period.\nThe following is a summary of the Company\u2019s Other Assets at April 30, 2020 and 2019.\nof 54\nSTAR GOLD CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2020\nNOTE 6 - INCOME TAXES\nThere was no income tax provision (benefit) for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019. The components of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets are as follows:\nDeferred income taxes arise from timing differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. As management of the Company cannot determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance equal to 100% of the deferred tax assets has been recorded at April 30, 2020 and 2019.\nA reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the Company\u2019s tax provision (benefit) is as follows:\nAt April 30, 2020, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $6,000,000, $4,845,000 of which expires between 2013 and 2037. The remaining balance of approximately $1,155,000 will never expire but its utilization is limited to 80% of taxable income in any future year.\nThe Company has no tax position at April 30, 2020 and 2019 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. It is not anticipated that unrecognized tax benefits would significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of the reporting date. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. No such interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at April 30, 2020 and 2019. The Company\u2019s federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2018 through 2020 remain open and subject to examination.\nof 54\nSTAR GOLD CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2020\nNOTE 7 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company rented office space from Marlin Property Management, LLC (\u201cMarlin\u201d) an entity owned by the spouse of the Company\u2019s former President and current Chairman of the Board of Directors. The lease was on a month-to-month basis as financial resources were available. The Company terminated the lease effective November 1, 2018. For the year ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, office rent was $Nil and $1,500, respectively. No rent was incurred under this agreement during the year ended April 30, 2020.\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2020, the Company paid a member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) for consulting and investor relation services in the amount of $8,000 which was charged to \u201cManagement and administrative\u201d expense on the Statement of Operations There was no expense for such services during the year ended April 30, 2019.\nEffective September 1, 2019, the Board authorized the Company to accrue for a period of six months a monthly total of $18,000 to reward, compensate and incentivize for the Chairman of the Board, two respective members of the Board, and the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Under the resolution, in the event of a change of control or sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, these individuals shall collectively be granted bonuses equal to an aggregate two per cent (2%) of the value of the change of control or sale. During the year ended April 30, 2020, the Company incurred management and administrative expenses of $108,000 associated with the accrual and made $19,000 of payments. These individuals have agreed to defer payment of the remaining balance due until sufficient cash is available.\nOn March 10, 2020, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board of Directors in the amount of $50,000. The note matures on March 10, 2022 and accrues interest at 6% per annum. For the year ended April 30, interest expense, related party on the promissory note was $419. Accrued interest payable to the related party of $419 is accrued in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities on the balance sheet at April 30, 2020.\nNOTE 8 - STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nOn October 26, 2018, the Company issued 960,417 shares of its common stock in lieu of cash payment for accounts payable. The value of the shares issued was $57,625, based on a price of $0.06 per share which was the fair value on the date of issuance. No shares of common stock have been issued during the year ended April 30, 2020.\nNOTE 9 - WARRANTS\nThe following is a summary of the Company\u2019s warrants to purchase shares of common stock activity:\nThe composition of the Company\u2019s warrants outstanding at April 30, 2020 is as follows:\nof 54\nSTAR GOLD CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2020\nNOTE 10 - STOCK OPTIONS\nOptions issued for mining interest\nIn consideration for its mining interest (see Note 4), the Company was obligated to issue stock options to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock based on \u201cfair market price\u201d which for financial statement purposes is considered to be the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the issue dates. Those costs are capitalized as Mining Interest.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, there were 500,000 options issued for mining interest at the exercise price of $0.04 per share that expire August 31, 2024. During the year ended April 30, 2020, in accordance with the 2019 Amendment to the Longstreet Agreement (see Note 4), the Company repriced 435,000 existing options to purchase Company common stock, to the exercise price of $0.04 per share, from exercise prices ranging from $0.05 to $0.80. The repriced options expiration date was extended to August 31, 2024. The fair value of the issuance and repricing was $16,044.\nOn January 16, 2019, the Company issued 45,000 stock options for mining interests with fair value of $2,250.\nOptions outstanding for mining interest totaled 435,000 at April 30, 2019 and 935,000 options at April 30, 2020 and are fully vested. As of April 30, 2020, the remaining weighted average term of the option grants for mining interest was 4.24 years. As of April 30, 2020, the weighted average exercise price of the option grants for mining interest was $0.04 per share.\nOptions issued under the 2011 Stock Option/Restricted Stock Plan\nThe Company established the 2011 Stock Option/Restricted Stock Plan. The Stock Option Plan is administered by the Board of Directors and provides for the grant of stock options to eligible individual including directors, executive officers and advisors that have furnished bona fide services to the Company not related to the sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction.\nThe Stock Option Plan has a fixed maximum percentage of 10% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares that are eligible for the plan pool, whereby the number of Shares under the plan increases automatically increases as the total number of shares outstanding increase. The number of shares subject to the Stock Option Plan and any outstanding awards will be adjusted appropriately by the Board of Directors if the Company\u2019s common stock is affected through a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, restructuring, reclassification dividend (other than quarterly cash dividends) or other distribution, stock split, spin-off or sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets.\nThe Stock Option plan also has terms and conditions, including without limitations that the exercise price for stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan must equal the stock\u2019s fair value, based on the closing price per share of common stock, at the time the stock option is granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes model and commonly utilized assumptions associated with the Black-Scholes methodology. Options granted under the Plan have a ten-year maximum term and varying vesting periods as determined by the Board.\nThe total value of stock option awards is expensed ratably over the vesting period of the employees receiving the awards. As of April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to stock-based options and awards. No options were issued under the 2011 Plan during the year ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes additional information about the options under the Company\u2019s Stock Option Plan as of April 30, 2020:\nSummary:\nThe following is a summary of the Company\u2019s stock options outstanding and exercisable:\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of all options vested and exercisable at April 30, 2020, was $47,425 based on the Company\u2019s closing price of $0.065 per common share at April 30, 2020.

    "section_9A": "ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAt the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a - 15(e) and Rule 15d - 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nDisclosure controls and procedures were not effective due primarily to a material weakness in the segregation of duties in the Company\u2019s internal control of financial reporting as discussed below.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) and all related information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2020, based on the criteria in a framework developed by the Company\u2019s management pursuant to and in compliance with the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of April 30, 2020, because management identified a material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting related to the segregation of duties as described below.\nWhile the Company does adhere to internal controls and processes that were designed and implemented based on the COSO report, it is difficult with a very limited staff to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the initiating and recording of transactions, thereby creating a segregation of duties weakness. Due to: (i) the significance of segregation of duties to the preparation of reliable financial statements; (ii) the significance of potential misstatement that could have resulted due to the deficient controls; and (iii) the absence of sufficient other mitigating controls, we determined that this control deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected.\nManagement\u2019s Remediation Initiatives.\nManagement has evaluated, and continues to evaluate, avenues for mitigating our internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls to completely mitigate internal control weaknesses have been deemed to be impractical and prohibitively costly, due to the size of our organization at the current time. Management expects to continue to use reasonable care in following and seeking improvements to effective internal control processes that have been and continue to be in use at the Company\nManagement is currently evaluating avenues for mitigating the Company\u2019s internal controls weaknesses but mitigating controls that are practical and cost effective may not be found based on the size, structure, and future existence of the organization. Since the Company has not generated any significant revenues, the Company is limited in its options for remediation efforts.\nof 54\nManagement, within the confines of its budgetary resources, will engage its outside accounting firm to assist with an assessment of the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal year ending April 30, 2021.\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that occurred prior to the Company\u2019s most recent financial quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.",
