It includes management\u2019s interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nSeveral factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements.\nCautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThe statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cforecast\u201d, \u201cgoal\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cobjective\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cprojection\u201d, \u201cseek\u201d, \u201cstrategy\u201d or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: federal, state and local regulatory and political trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; possible increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations; the impact of greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change; possible significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs; the inherent hazards and risks involved in distributing, transporting and storing natural gas; the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; adverse weather conditions; the impact of climate change; the inability to continue to hire, train and retain operational, technical and managerial personnel; increased dependence on technology that may hinder the Company's business if such technologies fail; the threat of cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information; natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control; the capital-intensive nature of our business; our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities, including commodity price volatility, counterparty performance or creditworthiness and interest rate risk; the concentration of our operations in Texas; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; changes in the availability and price of natural gas; increased costs of providing health care benefits, along with pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements; the outbreak of COVID-19 and its impact on business and economic conditions. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. Accordingly, these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nCritical\nAccounting Policy\nSummary of Policy\nFactors Influencing Application of the Policy\nRegulation\nOur distribution and pipeline operations meet the criteria of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, the financial results for these operations reflect the effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions to which we are subject.\nAs a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The amounts expected to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations.\nDiscontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities or changes in the accounting for our various regulatory mechanisms could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income.\nDecisions of regulatory authorities\nIssuance of new regulations or regulatory mechanisms\nAssessing the probability of the recoverability of deferred costs\nContinuing to meet the criteria of a cost-based, rate regulated entity for accounting purposes\nUnbilled Revenue\nWe follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for distribution segment revenues whereby revenues attributable to gas delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense.\nWhen permitted, we implement rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, subject to refund.We recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented.\nEstimates of delivered sales volumes based on actual tariff information and weather information and estimates of customer consumption and/or behavior\nEstimates of purchased gas costs related to estimated deliveries\nEstimates of amounts billed subject to refund\nCritical\nAccounting Policy\nSummary of Policy\nFactors Influencing Application of the Policy\nPension and other postretirement plans\nPension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a September 30 measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities.\nThe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year\u2019s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years.\nThe market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use of this methodology will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period.\nWe estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date.\nGeneral economic and market conditions\nAssumed investment returns by asset class\nAssumed future salary increases\nAssumed discount rate\nProjected timing of future cash disbursements\nHealth care cost experience trends\nParticipant demographic information\nActuarial mortality assumptions\nImpact of legislation\nImpact of regulation\nImpairment assessments\nWe review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill, as required by U.S. accounting standards.\nThe evaluation of our goodwill balances and other long-lived assets or identifiable assets for which uncertainty exists regarding the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets involves the assessment of future cash flows and external market conditions and other subjective factors that could impact the estimation of future cash flows including, but not limited to the commodity prices, the amount and timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances or market conditions could adversely affect these estimates, which could result in an impairment charge.\nGeneral economic and market conditions\nProjected timing and amount of future discounted cash flows\nJudgment in the evaluation of relevant data\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs described further in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, due to the passage of Kansas House Bill 2585, we remeasured our deferred tax liability and updated our state deferred tax rate. As a result, we recorded a non-cash income tax benefit of $21.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Additionally, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA) required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our new federal statutory income tax rate as of December 22, 2017. The remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities resulted in the recognition of a non-cash income tax benefit of $158.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Due to the non-recurring nature of these benefits, we believe that net income and diluted net income per share before the non-cash income tax benefits provide a more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than net income and diluted net income per share in order to allow investors to better analyze our core results and allow the information to be presented on a comparative basis. Accordingly, the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP measures, which are calculated as follows:\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nAtmos Energy strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value. Our commitment to modernizing our natural gas distribution and transmission systems requires a significant level of capital spending. We have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of these investments timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns. The execution of our capital spending program, the ability to recover these investments timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance.\nWe continue to execute our strategy well while managing the ongoing impacts of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Approximately 95 percent of our employees continue to work remotely as we provide essential services to ensure the safety and functionality of our critical infrastructure while taking precautions to provide a safe work environment for employees and customers.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we recorded net income of $601.4 million, or $4.89 per diluted share, compared to net income of $511.4 million, or $4.35 per diluted share in the prior year. After adjusting for a nonrecurring income tax benefit recognized during fiscal 2020, we recorded adjusted net income of $580.5 million, or $4.72 per diluted share for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nThe following table details our consolidated net income by segment during the last three fiscal years:\nThe year-over-year increase in adjusted net income of $69.1 million, or 14 percent, largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending and customer growth in our distribution business. We did not experience a material change in year-over-year residential revenue in our distribution segment due to COVID-19; however, we did experience a 10\npercent year-over-year decline in nonresidential revenue, including service and other revenues, primarily during the third and fourth fiscal quarter. The decline is partially offset by a reduction in certain operating and maintenance expenses.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, we implemented ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of $160.2 million and had ratemaking efforts in progress at September 30, 2020, seeking a total increase in annual operating income of $131.9 million. As of the date of this report, we have received approval to implement $106.6 million of this amount in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2020 increased 14 percent period-over-period, to $1.9 billion. Over 85 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems, with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we completed over $1.6 billion of long-term debt and equity financing. As of September 30, 2020, our equity capitalization was 60 percent and we had approximately $2.6 billion in total liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents and funds available through equity forward sales agreements.\nAs a result of the continued contribution and stability of our earnings, cash flows and capital structure, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 8.7% percent for fiscal 2021.\nDistribution Segment\nThe distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. The primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas.\nOur ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and, ultimately, separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The \u201cRatemaking Activity\u201d section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail.\nRevenues in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income.\nThe cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our operating income because these costs are recovered through our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. However, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense. This risk is currently mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 78 percent of our residential and commercial revenues. Additionally, higher gas costs may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities, resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we completed 17 regulatory proceedings in our distribution segment, resulting in a $110.9 million increase in annual operating income.\nReview of Financial and Operating Results\nFinancial and operational highlights for our distribution segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below.\n(1)\nIn accordance with our adoption of new accounting standards, changes in comprehensive income statement presentation were implemented on a retrospective basis and impacted previously issued financial statements for fiscal 2018.\n(2)\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2020 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2019\nOperating income for our distribution segment increased 12 percent, which primarily reflects:\n\u2022\nan $86.8 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily in our Mid-Tex, Mississippi, Louisiana and West Texas Divisions.\n\u2022\na $13.7 million increase from customer growth primarily in our Mid-Tex Division.\n\u2022\na $11.7 million decrease in operating expense in response to COVID-19:\n\u25e6\n$8.1 million associated with travel and entertainment and training.\n\u25e6\n$3.6 million associated with lower overtime/standby costs and benefit costs.\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022\na $18.4 million decrease attributable to COVID-19:\n\u25e6\n$5.9 million decrease in net consumption and transportation during the third and fourth fiscal quarter, primarily due to a 13 percent decrease in commercial volumes.\n\u25e6\n$6.3 million decrease in service order revenues primarily during the third and fourth quarter due to the cessation of collection activities during the third and fourth quarters.\n\u25e6\n$6.2 million increase in bad debt expense primarily due to the cessation of collection activities during the third and fourth quarters.\n\u2022\na $30.6 million increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments.\n\u2022\na $4.5 million increase in information technology spending to support the modernization of our systems.\nThe year-over-year change in other non-operating expense and interest charges of $12.9 million primarily reflects increased capitalized interest and AFUDC primarily due to increased capitalized spending, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt during fiscal 2020, an increase in community support spending and an increase in pension and other postretirement non-service costs.\nThe fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for our distribution segment is described in Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nThe following table shows our operating income by distribution division, in order of total rate base, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The presentation of our distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes.\nPipeline and Storage Segment\nOur pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of our APT Division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. Over 80 percent of this segment's revenues are derived from transportation and storage services provided by APT to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution companies, industrial and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers.\nOur pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our Texas and Louisiana service areas. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in Texas could influences the volumes of gas transported for shippers through Texas pipeline systems and rates for such transportation.\nThe results of APT are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers. Additionally, its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs.\nAPT annually uses GRIP to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year. On February 14, 2020, APT made a GRIP filing that covered changes in net investment from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 with a requested increase in operating income of $49.3 million. On May 20, 2020, the RRC approved the Company's GRIP filing.\nOn December 21, 2016, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of five percent to the demand fee charged by our natural gas transmission pipeline for each of the next 10 years, effective October 1, 2017.\nReview of Financial and Operating Results\nFinancial and operational highlights for our pipeline and storage segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below.\n(1)\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2020 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2019\nOperating income for our pipeline and storage segment increased seven percent, which primarily reflects:\n\u2022\na $53.2 million net increase due to rate adjustments from the GRIP filing approved in May 2019 and 2020. The increase in rates was driven by increased safety and reliability spending.\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022\na $13.6 million net decrease primarily associated with the tightening of regional spreads driven by a reduction in associated Permian Basin gas production.\n\u2022\na $12.5 million increase in depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments.\n\u2022\na $9.4 million increase in system maintenance expense primarily due to spending on hydro testing and in-line inspections.\nThe year-over-year change in other non-operating income and interest charges of $5.6 million reflects increased AFUDC primarily due to increased capital spending, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt during fiscal 2020.\nThe fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for our pipeline and storage segment is described in Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing. As of September 30, 2020, external debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, a $1.5 billion commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with a total availability from third-party lenders of approximately $2.2 billion. The commercial paper program and credit facilities provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves the Company's desired capital structure with an equity-to-total-capitalization ratio between 50% and 60%, inclusive of long-term and short-term debt. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis.\nWe have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows us to issue up to $4.0 billion in common stock and/or debt securities. As of the date of this report, approximately $2.4 billion of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement, which expires February 11, 2023.\nWe also have an at-the-market (ATM) equity sales program that allows us to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $1.0 billion, which expires February 11, 2023. At September 30, 2020, approximately $552 million of equity is available for issuance under this ATM equity sales program. Additionally, as of September 30, 2020, we have $345.2 million in proceeds from previously executed forward sale agreements that must be settled during fiscal 2021.\nThe liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's working capital needs and capital expenditures program.\nThe following table presents our capitalization as of September 30, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)\nInclusive of our finance leases as of September 30, 2020.\nCash Flows\nOur internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These factors include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and other factors.\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below.\nCash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 is described in Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nCash flows from operating activities\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we generated cash flow from operating activities of $1,038.0 million compared with $968.8 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in operating cash flows reflects positive cash effects of rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2019 and working capital changes, primarily as a result of the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchase gas cost mechanisms.\nCash flows from investing activities\nOur capital expenditures are primarily used to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission system through pipeline replacement and system modernization and to enhance and expand our system to meet customer needs. Over the last three fiscal years, approximately 87 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system.\nWe allocate our capital spending among our service areas using risk management models and subject matter experts to identify, assess and develop a plan of action to address our highest risk facilities. We have regulatory mechanisms in most of our service areas that provide the opportunity to include approved capital costs in rate base on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case. These mechanisms permit us a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on our investment without compromising safety or reliability.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we had $1.9 billion in capital expenditures compared with $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Capital spending increased by $242.2 million, or 14 percent, as a result of planned increases to modernize our system.\nCash flows from financing activities\nOur financing activities provided $883.8 million and $725.7 million in cash for fiscal years 2020 and 2019.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we received $1.6 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity. We completed a public offering of $300 million of 2.625% senior notes due 2029 and $500 million of 3.375% senior notes due 2049 and entered into a two year $200 million term loan. We received net proceeds from these offerings, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of $791.7 million. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we settled 6,101,916 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of approximately $624 million. The net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending, reduce short-term debt and other general corporate purposes.\nAdditionally, cash dividends increased due to a 9.5 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we received $1.7 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay at maturity our $450 million 8.50% unsecured senior notes and the related settlement of our interest rate swaps for $90.1 million, to repay at maturity our $125 million floating rate term loan, to reduce short-term debt, to support our capital spending and for other general corporate purposes. Cash dividends increased due to an 8.2 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding.\nThe following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)\nShare amounts do not include shares issued under forward sale agreements until the shares have been settled.\nCredit Ratings\nOur credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including but not limited to, debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and operating cash flow less dividends to debt. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the risks associated with our business and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate.\nOur debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard & Poor\u2019s Corporation (S&P) and Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Moody\u2019s). On December 16, 2019, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured long-term debt rating to A1 and changed their outlook to stable, citing our strong credit metrics as a result of continued improvement in rate design to minimize regulatory lag and our balanced fiscal policy.\nAs of September 30, 2020, our outlook and current debt ratings, which are all considered investment grade are as follows:\nA significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings.\nA credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating is AAA for S&P and Aaa for Moody\u2019s. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB- for S&P and Baa3 for Moody\u2019s. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nDebt Covenants\nWe were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2020. Our debt covenants are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at September 30, 2020.\n(1)\nLong-term debt excludes our finance lease obligations, which are separately reported within this table. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\n(2)\nInterest charges were calculated using the effective rate for each debt issuance.\n(3)\nFinance lease payments shown above include interest totaling $7.8 million. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\n(4)\nOperating lease payments shown above include interest totaling $41.4 million. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\n(5)\nRepresents liabilities for natural gas commodity financial instruments that were valued as of September 30, 2020. The ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk until the financial instruments are settled.\n(6)\nRepresents expected contributions to our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans, which are discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\n(7)\nRepresents liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions claimed or expected to be claimed on tax returns. The amount does not include interest and penalties that may be applied to these positions.\nWe maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts. Our Mid-Tex Division also maintains a limited number of long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices.\nAt September 30, 2020, we were committed to purchase 59.3 Bcf within one year, 57.0 Bcf within two to three years and 0.1 Bcf beyond three years under indexed contracts.\nRisk Management Activities\nIn our distribution and pipeline and storage segments, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings.\nWe record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices.\nThe following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our financial instruments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 (in thousands):\nThe fair value of our financial instruments at September 30, 2020, is presented below by time period and fair value source:\nRECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nRecent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nITEM 7A.",
    "section_7A": "ITEM 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates. Commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk is the potential increased cost we could incur when we issue debt instruments or to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities. Additionally, interest-rate risk could affect our ability to issue cost effective equity instruments.\nWe conduct risk management activities in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments. In our distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season. Our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe purchase natural gas for our distribution operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Therefore, our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates associated with our short-term commercial paper program and other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short-term interest rate risk. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our short-term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings. Had interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings increased by an average of one percent, our interest expense would not have materially increased during 2020.\nITEM 8.",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2020, in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 13, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2018s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2018s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nDetermination of Capital Costs\nDescription of the Matter\nAs more fully described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company capitalizes the direct and indirect costs of construction. Once a project is completed, it is placed into service and included in the Company\u2019s rate base. Costs of maintenance and repairs that are not included in the Company\u2019s rate base are charged to expense. For the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company capitalized approximately $1.9 billion of construction-related costs for regulated property, plant and equipment.\nAuditing management\u2019s identification of capital additions and maintenance and repairs expense involved significant effort and auditor judgment. These amounts have both a higher magnitude and a higher likelihood of potential misstatement. As a cost-based, rate-regulated entity, the rates charged to customers are designed to recover the entity\u2019s costs and provide a rate of return on rate base. Net property, plant and equipment is the most significant component of the Company\u2019s rate base. As a result, inappropriate capitalization of costs could affect the amount, timing and classification of revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s controls over the initial determination and approval of expenditures for either capital additions or maintenance and repair. For example, we selected a sample of projects initiated during the year to evaluate the effectiveness of management\u2019s review controls to determine the proper categorization of project expenditures as either capitalizable costs or current-period expense.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, testing a sample of projects initiated during the year, including the evaluation of the nature of the project, with Company personnel outside of accounting and financial reporting. For example, we evaluated project setup through inspection of each project\u2019s description for compliance with the Company\u2019s capitalization policy as described in Note 2 and a series of inquiries of the project approver to understand how they assessed whether projects should be treated as capital or expense. Other audit procedures included evaluating whether the descriptions and amounts included on third-party invoices either support or contradict the project classification as capital, evaluating the appropriateness of individuals capitalizing direct labor charges to projects by assessing the relevance of their job function to the capital project, and recalculating other overhead costs capitalized to projects.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2018s auditor since 1983.\nDallas, Texas\nNovember 13, 2020\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Nature of Business\nAtmos Energy Corporation (Atmos Energy or the \u201cCompany\u201d) and its subsidiaries are engaged in the regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage businesses. Through our distribution business, we deliver natural gas through sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential, commercial, public-authority and industrial customers through our six regulated distribution divisions in the service areas described below:\nDivision\nService Area\nAtmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division\nColorado, Kansas\nAtmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division\nKentucky, Tennessee, Virginia(1)\nAtmos Energy Louisiana Division\nLouisiana\nAtmos Energy Mid-Tex Division\nTexas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area\nAtmos Energy Mississippi Division\nMississippi\nAtmos Energy West Texas Division\nWest Texas\n(1)\nDenotes location where we have more limited service areas.\nIn addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system. Our distribution business is subject to federal and state regulation and/or regulation by local authorities in each of the states in which our distribution divisions operate. Our corporate headquarters and shared-services function are located in Dallas, Texas, and our customer support centers are located in Amarillo and Waco, Texas.\nOur pipeline and storage business, which is also subject to federal and state regulation, consists of the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas (APT) Division and our natural gas transmission business in Louisiana. The APT division provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third-party local distribution companies, industrial and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers. As part of its pipeline operations, APT manages five underground storage facilities in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary to the pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and sales of inventory on hand. Our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana are comprised of a 21-mile pipeline located in the New Orleans, Louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in Louisiana under a long-term contract and on a more limited basis, to third parties.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atmos Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated; however, we have not eliminated intercompany profits when such amounts are probable of recovery under the affiliates\u2019 rate regulation process.\nUse of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The most significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, unbilled revenues, contingency accruals, pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, risk management and trading activities, fair value measurements and the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRegulation - Our distribution and pipeline and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require cost-based, rate-regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the authorized recovery of costs due to regulatory decisions in their financial statements. As a result, certain costs are permitted to be capitalized rather than expensed because they can be recovered through rates. We record certain costs as regulatory assets when future recovery through customer rates is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized.\nSubstantially all of our regulatory assets are recorded as a component of deferred charges and other assets and our regulatory liabilities are recorded as a component of other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities. Deferred\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\ngas costs are recorded either in other current assets or liabilities and the long-term portion of regulatory excess deferred taxes and regulatory cost of removal obligation are reported separately. Significant regulatory assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 included the following:\n(1)\nInfrastructure mechanisms in Texas, Louisiana and Tennessee allow for the deferral of all eligible expenses associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to these rules, including the recording of interest on the deferred expenses until the next rate proceeding (rate case or annual rate filing), at which time investment and costs would be recovered through base rates.\n(2)\nDue to the passage of the Kansas House Bill 2585, on June 1, 2020, we remeasured our deferred tax liability and updated our state deferred tax rate resulting in a $12.1 million regulatory liability as of September 30, 2020. The remaining amount reflects the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability included in our rate base as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA). Of this amount, $20.9 million as of September 30, 2020 and $21.2 million as of September 30, 2019 is recorded in other current liabilities. See Note 13 for further information.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we received regulatory orders in most states to defer into a regulatory asset all expenses, beyond the normal course of business, related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including bad debt expense. As of September 30, 2020, no amounts have been recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities for expenses related to COVID-19.\nRevenue recognition\nDistribution Revenues\nDistribution revenues represent the delivery of natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and public authority customers at prices based on tariff rates established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Revenue is recognized and our performance obligation is satisfied over time when natural gas is delivered and simultaneously consumed by our customers. We have elected to use the invoice practical expedient and recognize revenue for volumes delivered that we have the right to invoice our customers. We read meters and bill our customers on a monthly cycle basis. Accordingly, we estimate volumes from the last meter read to the balance sheet date and accrue revenue for gas delivered but not yet billed.\nIn our Texas and Mississippi jurisdictions, we pay franchise fees and gross receipt taxes to operate in these service areas. These franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are required to be paid regardless of our ability to collect from our customers. Accordingly, we account for these amounts on a gross basis in revenue and we record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income.\nPipeline and Storage Revenues\nPipeline and storage revenues primarily represent the transportation and storage of natural gas on our APT system and the transmission of natural gas through our 21-mile pipeline in Louisiana. APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution companies and certain industrial customers under tariff rates approved by\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nthe RRC. APT also provides certain transportation and storage services to industrial and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers, under negotiated rates. Our pipeline in Louisiana is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our Louisiana Division under a long-term contract and on a more limited basis to third parties. The demand fee charged to our Louisiana Division is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. We also manage two asset management plans with distribution affiliates of the Company at terms that have been approved by the applicable state regulatory commissions. The performance obligations for these transportation customers are satisfied by means of transporting customer-supplied gas to the designated location. Revenue is recognized and our performance obligation is satisfied over time when natural gas is delivered to the customer. Management determined that these arrangements qualify for the invoice practical expedient for recognizing revenue. For demand fee arrangements, revenue is recognized and our performance obligation is satisfied by standing ready to transport natural gas over the period of each individual month.\nAlternative Revenue Program Revenues\nIn our distribution segment, we have weather-normalization adjustment mechanisms that serve to minimize the effects of weather on our residential and commercial revenues. Additionally, APT has a regulatory mechanism that requires that we share with its tariffed customers 75% of the difference between the total non-tariffed revenues earned during a test period and a revenue benchmark of $69.4 million that was established in its most recent rate case. Differences between actual revenues and revenues calculated under these mechanisms adjust the amount billed to customers. These mechanisms are considered to be alternative revenue programs under accounting standards generally accepted in the United States as they are deemed to be contracts between us and our regulator. Accordingly, revenue under these mechanisms are excluded from revenue from contracts with customers.\nPurchased gas costs - Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of their non-gas costs. There is no margin generated through purchased gas cost adjustments, but they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in our distribution segment\u2019s gas costs. The effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCash and cash equivalents - We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts - Accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority and other customers. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based on our collection experience or where we are aware of a specific customer\u2019s inability or reluctance to pay. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected. Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible.\nGas stored underground - Our gas stored underground is comprised of natural gas injected into storage to support the winter season withdrawals for our distribution operations. The average cost method is used for all of our distribution operations. Gas in storage that is retained as cushion gas to maintain reservoir pressure is classified as property, plant and equipment and is valued at cost.\nProperty, plant and equipment - Regulated property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost, net of contributions in aid of construction. The cost of additions includes direct construction costs, payroll related costs (taxes, pensions and other benefits), administrative and general costs and an allowance for funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) represents the capitalizable total cost of funds used to finance the construction of major projects.\nThe following table details amounts capitalized for the fiscal year ended September 30.\nMajor renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that are recoverable through our regulatory rate base are capitalized while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not capitalizable are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nlarge projects are accumulated in construction in progress until the project is completed. When the project is completed, tested and placed in service, the balance is transferred to the regulated plant in service account included in the rate base and depreciation begins.\nRegulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated at various rates on a straight-line basis. These rates are approved by our regulatory commissions and are comprised of two components: one based on average service life and one based on cost of removal. Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal expense as a component of depreciation expense. The related cost of removal accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and equipment is retired, removal expenses less salvage, are charged to the regulatory cost of removal accrual. The composite depreciation rate was 3.0 percent, 3.1 percent and 3.2 percent for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nOther property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based upon estimated useful lives.\nAsset retirement obligations - We record a liability at fair value for an asset retirement obligation when the legal obligation to retire the asset has been incurred with an offsetting increase to the carrying value of the related asset. Accretion of the asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense.\nAs of September 30, 2020 and 2019, we had asset retirement obligations of $20.3 million and $17.1 million. Additionally, we had $14.4 million and $11.3 million of asset retirement costs recorded as a component of property, plant and equipment that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying associated assets.\nWe believe we have a legal obligation to retire our natural gas storage facilities. However, we have not recognized an asset retirement obligation associated with our storage facilities because we are not able to determine the settlement date of this obligation as we do not anticipate taking our storage facilities out of service permanently. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of this obligation.\nImpairment of long-lived assets - We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that other long-lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value is recorded.\nGoodwill - We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or more frequently as impairment indicators arise. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative assessment, as permitted under U.S. GAAP. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the assessment performed, we determined that our goodwill was not impaired. Although not applicable for the fiscal 2020 analysis, if the qualitative assessment resulted in impairment indicators, we would then use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These calculations are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill exceeds its fair value.\nLease accounting - We adopted the provisions of the new lease accounting standard beginning on October 1, 2019. Results for reporting periods beginning on October 1, 2019 are presented under the new lease accounting standard and prior periods are presented under the former lease accounting standard. Upon adoption, we recorded right of use assets and lease liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 6 for further discussion regarding the accounting polices for these leases.\nMarketable securities - As of September 30, 2020, we hold marketable securities classified as either equity or debt securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, changes in fair value of our equity securities are recorded in net income, while debt securities, which are considered available for sale securities, are reported at market value with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). During fiscal 2018 and under the previous accounting guidance, all our debt and equity securities were considered available for sale securities.\nWe regularly evaluate the performance of our available for sale debt securities on an investment by investment basis for impairment, taking into consideration the securities\u2019 purpose, volatility and current returns. If a determination is made that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nFinancial instruments and hedging activities - We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments and to mitigate interest rate risk. The objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to our business and are discussed in Note 14.\nWe record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the statement of comprehensive income. These financial instruments are reported as risk management assets and liabilities and are classified as current or noncurrent other assets or liabilities based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. We record the cash flow impact of our financial instruments in operating cash flows based upon their balance sheet classification.\nThe timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the statement of comprehensive income depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as they occur.\nFinancial Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk\nIn our distribution segment, the costs associated with and the realized gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk are included in our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is no earnings impact on our distribution segment as a result of the use of these financial instruments.\nFinancial Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk\nIn connection with the planned issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. We currently manage this risk through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We designate these financial instruments as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements are executed. Unrealized gains and losses associated with the instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). When the instruments settle, the realized gain or loss is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized as a component of interest charges over the life of the related financing arrangement. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, no cash was required to be held in margin accounts.\nFair Value Measurements - We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements.\nFair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances.\nAmounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, including, but not limited to, the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions and interest rates, each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions.\nAuthoritative accounting literature establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value based on observable and unobservable data. The hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three levels, with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The levels of the hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1 - Represents unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is defined as a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOur Level 1 measurements consist primarily of our debt and equity securities. The Level 1 measurements for investments in the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the Master Trust), Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan and postretirement benefit plan consist primarily of exchange-traded financial instruments.\nLevel 2 - Represents pricing inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability as of the reporting date. These inputs are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Our Level 2 measurements primarily consist of non-exchange-traded financial instruments, such as over-the-counter options and swaps and municipal and corporate bonds where market data for pricing is observable. The Level 2 measurements for investments in our Master Trust, Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan and postretirement benefit plan consist primarily of non-exchange traded financial instruments such as corporate bonds and government securities.\nLevel 3 - Represents generally unobservable pricing inputs which are developed based on the best information available, including our own internal data, in situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. The pricing inputs utilized reflect what a market participant would use to determine fair value. We currently do not have any Level 3 investments.\nPension and other postretirement plans - Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. Our measurement date is September 30. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. For the valuation performed as of September 30, 2020, decreases in the discount rate resulted in actuarial losses that increased our plan obligations.\nThe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors when making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year\u2019s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss is amortized over the expected future working lifetime of the plan participants.\nThe expected return on plan assets is then calculated by applying the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to the market-related value of the plan assets. The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period.\nWe use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net gains or losses in excess of ten percent of the larger of the pension benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. The period of amortization is the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under the plan.\nWe estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our annual postretirement net cost based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon the annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date.\nOn October 1, 2018 we adopted new accounting guidance, which required we present only the current service cost component of the net benefit cost within operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The remaining components of net benefit cost are recorded in other non-operating income (expense) in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The change in presentation of these costs was implemented on a retrospective basis as required by the guidance. In lieu of determining how each component of the net periodic benefit cost was actually reflected in the fiscal 2018 statement of comprehensive income, we elected to utilize a practical expedient that permits the use of the amounts disclosed for these costs in our pension and post-retirement benefit plans footnote as the basis to retroactively apply this standard.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nIn addition, only the service cost component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization and we continue to capitalize these costs into property, plant and equipment. Additionally, we defer into a regulatory asset the portion of non-service components of net periodic benefit cost that are capitalizable for regulatory purposes.\nIncome taxes - Income taxes are determined based on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.\nThe Company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest charges. We recognize penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of miscellaneous income (expense) in accordance with regulatory requirements.\nTax collections - We are allowed to recover from customers revenue-related taxes that are imposed upon us. We record such taxes as operating expenses and record the corresponding customer charges as operating revenues. However, we do collect and remit various other taxes on behalf of various governmental authorities, and we record these amounts in our consolidated balance sheets on a net basis. We do not collect income taxes from our customers on behalf of governmental authorities.\nContingencies - In the normal course of business, we are confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims made by third parties or the action of various regulatory agencies. For such matters, we record liabilities when they are considered probable and estimable, based on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure.\nSubsequent events - Except as noted in Note 7 regarding the public offering of senior notes, no events occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date that would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nAccounting pronouncements adopted in fiscal 2020\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a comprehensive new leasing standard that requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use (ROU) asset for all leases, including operating leases on its balance sheet. The new standard was effective for us beginning on October 1, 2019. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our adoption of the new lease standard and the related disclosures.\nAccounting pronouncements that will be effective after fiscal 2020\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued optional guidance which will ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The amendments can be elected immediately, as of March 12, 2020, through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating if we will apply the optional guidance as we assess the impact of the cessation of LIBOR on our current contracts and hedging relationships and the potential impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for income taxes which removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod allocations and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The new standard also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, such as recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The new standard will be effective for us beginning on October 1, 2021; early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the new standard will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which will require credit losses on most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be measured using an expected credit loss model. Under this model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument from the date of initial recognition of that instrument. In contrast, current U.S. GAAP is based on an incurred loss model that delays recognition of credit losses until it is probable the loss has been incurred. The new guidance also introduces a new impairment recognition model for available-for-sale debt\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nsecurities that will require credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance account. The new standard was effective for us beginning on October 1, 2020. We do not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n3. Segment Information\nAs of September 30, 2020, we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following two reportable segments:\n\u2022\nThe distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states.\n\u2022\nThe pipeline and storage segment is comprised primarily of the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana.\nOur determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating units under which we manage sales of various products and services to customers. Although our distribution segment operations are geographically dispersed, they are aggregated and reported as a single segment as each natural gas distribution division has similar economic characteristics. In addition, because the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana have similar economic characteristics, they have been aggregated and reported as a single segment.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on net income or loss of the respective operating units. We allocate interest and pension expense to the pipeline and storage segment; however, there is no debt or pension liability recorded on the pipeline and storage segment balance sheet. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated; however, we have not eliminated intercompany profits when such amounts are probable of recovery under the affiliates\u2019 rate regulation process. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if each segment\u2019s income taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.\nIncome statements and capital expenditures by segment are shown in the following tables.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes our revenues from external parties, excluding intersegment revenues, by products and services for the fiscal years ended September 30.\nBalance sheet information at September 30, 2020 and 2019 by segment is presented in the following tables.\n4. Earnings Per Share\nWe use the two-class method of computing earnings per share because we have participating securities in the form of non-vested restricted stock units with a nonforfeitable right to dividend equivalents, for which vesting is predicated solely on the passage of time. The calculation of earnings per share using the two-class method excludes income attributable to these participating securities from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact of those shares from the denominator. Basic weighted average shares outstanding is calculated based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Also, this calculation includes fully vested stock awards that have not yet been issued as common stock. Additionally, the weighted average shares outstanding for diluted EPS includes the incremental effects of the forward sale agreements, discussed in Note 8, when the impact is dilutive.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nBasic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended September 30 are calculated as follows:\n5. Revenue\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue from contracts with customers by customer type and segment and provides a reconciliation to total operating revenues, including intersegment revenues, for the period presented.\n(1)\nIn our distribution segment, we have weather-normalization adjustment mechanisms that serve to mitigate the effects of weather on our revenue. Additionally, APT has a regulatory mechanism that requires that we share with its tariffed customers 75% of the difference between the total non-tariffed revenues earned during a test period and a revenue benchmark.\n6. Leases\nWe adopted the provisions of the new lease accounting standard beginning on October 1, 2019, using the optional transition method, which allowed us to apply the provisions of the new standard to all leases that existed as of the date of adoption. Therefore, results for reporting periods beginning on October 1, 2019 are presented under the new lease accounting standard and prior periods are presented under the former lease accounting standard.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe new guidance included several practical expedients to facilitate the implementation of the new standard. The following summarizes the practical expedients we used to implement the standard.\n\u2022We elected to bundle our lease and non-lease components as a single component for all asset classes.\n\u2022We elected not to perform the following:\n\u25e6Evaluate existing or expired land easements prior to October 1, 2019 to determine if they are leases.\n\u25e6Include short-term leases in the calculation of our lease liability.\n\u25e6Evaluate existing or expired contracts to determine if they are leases.\n\u25e6Assess lease classification for existing or expired leases.\n\u25e6Review initial direct costs for existing leases.\n\u25e6Use hindsight in order to determine the lease term or impairment of our ROU assets.\nUpon adoption of this new guidance, we recorded ROU assets and lease liabilities of $231.3 million. Additionally, we reclassified a net $6.5 million of accrued and prepaid lease costs to the ROU asset and $2.5 million related to an existing finance lease from deferred credits and other liabilities to long-term debt.\nImplementation of the new lease accounting guidance had no material impact on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income or our consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, we did not record a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on the opening balance sheet.\nNew Lease Accounting Policy\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the agreement based on the terms and conditions in the contract. A contract contains a lease if there is an identified asset and we have the right to control the asset. We are the lessee for substantially all of our leasing activity, which primarily includes operating leases for office and warehouse space, tower space, vehicles and heavy equipment used in our operations. We are also a lessee in finance leases for service centers.\nWe record a lease liability and a corresponding ROU asset for all of our leases with a term greater than 12 months. For lease contracts containing renewal and termination options, we include the option period in the lease term when it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised. We most frequently assume renewal options at the inception of the arrangement for our tower and fleet leases, based on our anticipated use of the assets. Real estate leases that contain a renewal option are evaluated on a lease-by-lease basis to determine if the option period should be included in the lease term. Currently, we have not included material renewal options for real estate leases in our ROU asset or lease liability. The following table presents our weighted average remaining lease term for our leases.\nThe lease liability represents the present value of all lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease liability is the rate implicit in the lease unless that rate cannot be readily determined. We use the implicit rate stated in the agreement to determine the lease liability for our fleet leases. We use our corporate collateralized incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for all other lease agreements. This rate is appropriate because we believe it represents the rate we would have incurred to borrow funds to acquire the leased asset over a similar term. We calculated this rate using a combination of inputs, including our current credit rating, quoted market prices of interest rates for our publicly traded unsecured debt, observable market yield curve data for peer companies with a credit rating one notch higher than our current credit rating and the lease term.\nThe following table represents our weighted average discount rate:\nThe ROU asset represents the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and is equal to the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments and any lease incentives that have been paid to us or when we are reasonably certain to incur costs equal to or greater than the allowance defined in the contract.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nVariable payments included in our leasing arrangements are expensed in the period in which the obligation for these payments is incurred. Variable payments are dependent on usage, output or may vary for other reasons. Most of our variable lease expense is related to tower leases that have escalating payments based on changes to a stated CPI index, and usage of certain office equipment.\nWe have not provided material residual value guarantees for our leases, nor do our leases contain material restrictions or covenants.\nLease costs for the year ended September 30, 2020 are presented in the table below. These costs include both amounts recognized in expense and amounts capitalized. For the year ended September 30, 2020 we did not have material short-term lease costs or variable lease costs.\nOur ROU assets and lease liabilities are presented as follows on the consolidated balance sheets:\nOther pertinent information related to leases was as follows. During the year ended September 30, 2020, amounts paid in cash for our finance leases were not material.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nMaturities of our lease liabilities as of September 30, 2020 were as follows:\nDisclosures Related to Prior Periods\nThe future minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2019 were as follows:\n(1)\nFuture minimum lease payments do not include amounts for fleet leases and other de minimis items that can be renewed beyond the initial lease term. The Company anticipates renewing the leases beyond the initial term, but the anticipated payments associated with the renewals do not meet the definition of expected minimum lease payments and therefore are not included above. Expected payments are $17.6 million in 2020, $18.0 million in 2021, $11.8 million in 2022, $8.5 million in 2023, $5.4 million in 2024 and $2.7 million thereafter.\nConsolidated lease and rental expense amounted to $40.4 million and $33.8 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n7. Debt\nLong-term debt\nLong-term debt at September 30, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:\nMaturities of long-term debt, excluding our finance lease obligations, at September 30, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nOn October 1, 2020, we completed a public offering of $600 million of 1.50% senior notes due 2031. The net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, of $592.5 million, were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program and the related settlement of our interest rate swaps. The effective interest rate on these notes is 1.71%, after giving effect to the offering costs.\nOn April 9, 2020, we entered into a two year, $200 million term loan agreement that bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.25 percent. The term loan was used to pay down borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program.\nOn October 2, 2019, we completed a public offering of $300 million of 2.625% senior notes due 2029 and $500 million of 3.375% senior notes due 2049. We received net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of $791.7 million, that were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of working capital\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nborrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program. The effective interest rate on these notes was 2.72% and 3.42%, after giving effect to the offering costs.\nShort-term Debt\nWe utilize short-term debt to provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves the Company\u2019s desired capital structure with an equity-to-capitalization ratio between 50% and 60%, inclusive of long-term and short-term debt. Our short-term borrowing requirements are driven primarily by construction work in progress and the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply our customers\u2019 needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements. Our short-term borrowings typically reach their highest levels in the winter months.\nAs of September 30, 2020, our short-term borrowing requirements were satisfied through a combination of a $1.5 billion commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders that provide $2.2 billion of total working capital funding.\nThe primary source of our funding is our commercial paper program, which is supported by a five-year unsecured $1.5 billion credit facility that expires on September 25, 2023. The facility bears interest at a base rate or at a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable interest period, plus a margin ranging from zero percent to 1.25 percent, based on the Company\u2019s credit ratings. Additionally, the facility contains a $250 million accordion feature, which provides the opportunity to increase the total committed loan to $1.75 billion. At September 30, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. At September 30, 2019, a total of $464.9 million was outstanding with weighted average interest rates of 2.24% and weighted average maturities of less than one month.\nAdditionally, we had a $25 million 364-day unsecured facility that was renewed on April 1, 2020 and increased to $50 million, which is used to provide working capital funding. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2020.\nFinally, we had a $10 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility, which was replaced on April 30, 2020, with a new $50 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility, which is used to issue letters of credit and to provide working capital funding. At September 30, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the new facility; however, outstanding letters of credit reduced the total amount available to us under our $50 million unsecured revolving facility to $44.4 million.\nOn April 23, 2020, we executed a new $600 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility to provide additional working capital funding. The facility bears interest at a base rate or at a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable interest period, plus a margin ranging from zero percent to 1.25 percent, based on the Company's credit ratings. At September 30, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.\nDebt Covenants\nThe availability of funds under these credit facilities is subject to conditions specified in the respective credit agreements, all of which we currently satisfy. These conditions include our compliance with financial covenants and the continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained in these agreements. We are required by the financial covenants in each of these facilities to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of total-debt-to-total-capitalization of no greater than 70 percent. At September 30, 2020, our total-debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined, was 42 percent. In addition, both the interest margin and the fee that we pay on unused amounts under each of these facilities are subject to adjustment depending upon our credit ratings.\nThese credit facilities and our public indentures contain usual and customary covenants for our business, including covenants substantially limiting liens, substantial asset sales and mergers. Additionally, our public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures, as well as certain of our revolving credit agreements, each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of $15 million to in excess of $100 million becomes due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2020. If we were unable to comply with our debt covenants, we would likely be required to repay our outstanding balances on demand, provide additional collateral or take other corrective actions.\n8. Shareholders' Equity\nShelf Registration, At-the-Market Equity Sales Program and Equity Issuances\nOn February 11, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows us to issue up to $4.0 billion in common stock and/or debt securities, which expires February 11, 2023. This shelf registration statement replaced our previous shelf registration statement which was filed on November 13, 2018 (2018 Registration Statement). At September 30, 2020, approximately $3.0 billion of securities remained available for issuance under\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nthe shelf registration statement. Following the completion of the $600 million senior unsecured note offering on October 1, 2020 (see Note 7), approximately $2.4 billion of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement.\nOn February 12, 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement under the shelf registration statement relating to an at-the-market (ATM) equity sales program (February 2020 ATM) under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $1.0 billion (including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into concurrently with the ATM equity sales program). This ATM equity sales program replaced our previous ATM equity sales program, filed on November 19, 2018 (November 2018 ATM), which was exhausted during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, we executed forward sales under the February 2020 ATM and the November 2018 ATM equity sales programs with various forward sellers who borrowed and sold 4,808,051 shares of our common stock for $523.2 million. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2020, we settled forward sale agreements with respect to 5,616,727 shares that had been borrowed and sold by various forward sellers under the November 2018 ATM and the February 2020 ATM for net proceeds of $581.5 million. As of September 30, 2020, the February 2020 ATM program had approximately $552 million of equity available for issuance.\nOn November 30, 2018, we filed a prospectus supplement under the registration statement relating to an underwriting agreement to sell 5,390,836 shares of our common stock for $500 million. After expenses, net proceeds from the offering were $494.1 million. Concurrently, we entered into separate forward sale agreements with two forward sellers who borrowed and sold 2,668,464 shares of our common stock for $247.5 million. During the year ended September 30, 2019, we settled forward sale agreements with respect to 2,183,275 of the shares that had been borrowed and sold for net proceeds of $200.0 million. During the year ended September 30, 2020, we settled the remaining 485,189 shares for net proceeds of $44.4 million.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2019, we executed forward sales under the November 2018 ATM with various forward sellers who borrowed and sold 4,144,671 shares of our common stock at an aggregate price of $425.0 million.\nIf we had settled all shares that remain available under our outstanding forward sale agreements as of September 30, 2020, we would have received proceeds of $345.2 million, based on a net price of $103.48 per share. Additional details are presented below.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nWe record deferred gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to available-for-sale debt securities and interest rate agreement cash flow hedges. Deferred gains (losses) for our available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in earnings upon settlement, while deferred gains (losses) related to our interest rate agreement cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings as a component of interest charges, as they are amortized. The following tables provide the components of our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balances, net of the related tax effects allocated to each component of other comprehensive income (loss).\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n9. Retirement and Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans\nWe have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit plans that together cover most of our employees. We also maintain post-retirement plans that provide health care benefits to retired employees. Finally, we sponsor a defined contribution plan that covers substantially all employees. These plans are discussed in further detail below.\nAs a rate regulated entity, most of our net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recoverable through our rates over a period of up to 15 years. A portion of these costs is capitalized into our rate base or deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. The remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense or other non-operating expense. Additionally, the amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost that have been recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities are as follows:\nDefined Benefit Plans\nEmployee Pension Plan\nAs of September 30, 2020, we maintained one cash balance defined benefit plan, the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan (the Plan). The Plan was established effective January 1999 and covers most of the employees of Atmos Energy that were hired on or before September 30, 2010. Effective October 1, 2010, the plan was closed to new participants. The assets of the Plan are held within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the Master Trust).\nOpening account balances were established for participants as of January 1999 equal to the present value of their respective accrued benefits under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of December 31, 1998. The Plan credits an allocation to each participant\u2019s account at the end of each year according to a formula based on the participant\u2019s age, service and total pay (excluding incentive pay). In addition, at the end of each year, a participant\u2019s account is credited with interest on the employee\u2019s prior year account balance. Participants are fully vested in their account balances after three years of service and may choose to receive their account balances as a lump sum or an annuity.\nGenerally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDuring fiscal 2020, we did not make a contribution to the Plan. During fiscal 2019 we contributed $8.5 million in cash to the Plan to achieve a desired level of funding while maximizing the tax deductibility of this payment. Based upon market conditions at September 30, 2020, the current funded position of the Plan and the funding requirements under the PPA, we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2021. However, we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels.\nWe make investment decisions and evaluate performance of the assets in the Master Trust on a medium-term horizon of at least three to five years. We also consider our current financial status when making recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust\u2019s assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust\u2019s assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk and meet the Master Trust\u2019s long-term asset investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors.\nTo achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust\u2019s assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets and cash and cash equivalents. Investments in equity securities are diversified among the market\u2019s various subsectors in an effort to diversify risk and maximize returns. Fixed income securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash equivalents are invested in securities that either are short term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash with modest risk.\nThe following table presents asset allocation information for the Master Trust as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.\nAt September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Plan held 716,700 shares of our common stock which represented 13.0 percent and 15.4 percent of total Plan assets. These shares generated dividend income for the Plan of approximately $1.6 million and $1.5 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nOur employee pension plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates and demographic data. We review the estimates and assumptions underlying our employee pension plans annually based upon a September 30 measurement date. The development of our assumptions is fully described in our significant accounting policies in Note 2. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension liability for the Plan was determined as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 and the actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost for the Plan was determined as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. On October 21, 2020, the Society of Actuaries released its annually-updated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the United States. As of September 30, 2020, we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table.\nAdditional assumptions are presented in the following table:\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table presents the Plan\u2019s accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and funded status as of September 30, 2020 and 2019:\nNet periodic pension cost for the Plan for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented in the following table.\n(1)\nThe components of net periodic cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item other non-operating income (expense) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or are capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets as a regulatory asset or liability, as described in Note 2.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan's assets at fair value as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. As required by authoritative accounting literature, assets are categorized in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The methods used to determine fair value for the assets held by the Plan are fully described in Note 2. Investments in our common/collective trusts and limited partnerships that are measured at net asset value per share equivalent are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. The net asset value amounts presented are intended to reconcile the fair value hierarchy to the total investments. In addition to the assets shown below, the Plan had net accounts receivable of $0.7 million and $1.3 million at September 30, 2020 and 2019, which materially approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets.\n(1)\nThe fair value of our common/collective trusts and limited partnerships are measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. There are no redemption restrictions, redemption notice periods or unfunded commitments for these investments. The redemption frequency is daily.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plans\nWe have three nonqualified supplemental plans which provide additional pension, disability and death benefits to our officers, division presidents and certain other employees of the Company.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe first plan is referred to as the Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan (SEBP) and covers our corporate officers and certain other employees of the Company who were employed on or before August 12, 1998. The SEBP is a defined benefit arrangement which provides a benefit equal to 75 percent of covered compensation under which benefits paid from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the benefits under the SEBP.\nIn August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) (formerly known as the Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan), which covers all corporate officers selected to participate in the plan between August 12, 1998 and August 5, 2009. The SERP is a defined benefit arrangement which provides a benefit equal to 60 percent of covered compensation under which benefits paid from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the benefits under the SERP.\nEffective August 5, 2009, we adopted a new defined benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the 2009 SERP), for corporate officers or any other employees selected at the discretion of the Board. Under the 2009 SERP, a nominal account has been established for each participant, to which the Company contributes at the end of each calendar year an amount equal to ten percent (25 percent for members of the Management Committee appointed on or after January 1, 2016) of the total of each participant\u2019s base salary and cash incentive compensation earned during each prior calendar year, beginning December 31, 2009. The benefits vest after three years of service and attainment of age 55 and earn interest credits at the same annual rate as the Company\u2019s Pension Account Plan.\nDue to the retirement of an executive of the company during fiscal 2020, we recognized a one-time settlement charge of $9.2 million and paid a $22.7 million lump sum in relation to the retirement.\nSimilar to our employee pension plans, we review the estimates and assumptions underlying our supplemental plans annually based upon a September 30 measurement date using the same techniques as our employee pension plans. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension liability for the supplemental plans were determined as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 and the actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost for the supplemental plans were determined as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. These assumptions are presented in the following table:\n(1)\nReflects a weighted average discount rate for pension cost for fiscal 2020 and 2018 due to the settlements during the year.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table presents the supplemental plans\u2019 accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and funded status as of September 30, 2020 and 2019:\nAssets for the supplemental plans are held in separate rabbi trusts. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, assets held in the rabbi trusts consisted of equity securities of $41.9 million and $44.0 million, which are included in our fair value disclosures in Note 15.\nNet periodic pension cost for the supplemental plans for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented in the following table.\n(1)\nThe components of net periodic cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item other non-operating income (expense) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or are capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets as a regulatory asset or liability, as described in Note 2.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nThe following benefit payments for our defined benefit plans, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in the following fiscal years:\nPostretirement Benefits\nWe sponsor the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Atmos Retiree Medical Plan). This plan provides medical and prescription drug protection to all qualified participants based on their date of retirement. The Atmos Retiree Medical Plan provides different levels of benefits depending on the level of coverage chosen by the participants and the terms of predecessor plans; however, we generally pay 80 percent of the projected net claims and administrative costs and participants pay the remaining 20 percent. Effective January 1, 2015, for employees who had not met the participation requirements by September 30, 2009, the contribution rates for the Company are limited to a three percent cost increase in claims and administrative costs each year, with the participant responsible for the additional costs.\nGenerally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of ERISA. However, additional voluntary contributions are made annually as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. We expect to contribute between $15 million and $25 million to our postretirement benefits plan during fiscal 2021.\nWe maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the assets in our postretirement benefits plan to ensure the assets funding the postretirement benefit plan are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk. We also consider our current financial status when making recommendations and decisions regarding the postretirement benefits plan.\nWe currently invest the assets funding our postretirement benefit plan in diversified investment funds which consist of common stocks, preferred stocks and fixed income securities. The diversified investment funds may invest up to 75 percent of assets in common stocks and convertible securities. The following table presents asset allocation information for the postretirement benefit plan assets as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.\nSimilar to our employee pension and supplemental plans, we review the estimates and assumptions underlying our postretirement benefit plan annually based upon a September 30 measurement date using the same techniques as our employee pension plans. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension liability for our postretirement plan were determined as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 and the actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost for the postretirement plan were determined as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe assumptions are presented in the following table:\nThe following table presents the postretirement plan\u2019s benefit obligation and funded status as of September 30, 2020 and 2019:\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNet periodic postretirement cost for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented in the following table.\n(1)\nThe components of net periodic cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item other non-operating income (expense) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or are capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets as a regulatory asset or liability, as described in Note 2.\nWe are currently recovering other postretirement benefits costs through our regulated rates in substantially all of our service areas under accrual accounting as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Other postretirement benefits costs have been specifically addressed in rate orders in each jurisdiction served by our Kentucky/Mid-States, West Texas, Mid-Tex and Mississippi Divisions as well as our Kansas jurisdiction and APT or have been included in a rate case and not disallowed. Management believes that this accounting method is appropriate and will continue to seek rate recovery of accrual-based expenses in its ratemaking jurisdictions that have not yet approved the recovery of these expenses.\nThe following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Retiree Medical Plan\u2019s assets at fair value as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. The methods used to determine fair value for the assets held by the Retiree Medical Plan are fully described in Note 2.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nThe following benefit payments paid by us, retirees and prescription drug subsidy payments for our postretirement benefit plans, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in the following fiscal years. Company payments for fiscal 2020 include contributions to our postretirement plan trusts.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nThe Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Savings Plan and Trust (the Retirement Savings Plan) covers substantially all employees and is subject to the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective January 1, 2007, employees automatically become participants of the Retirement Savings Plan on the date of employment. Participants may elect a salary reduction up to a maximum of 65 percent of eligible compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. New participants are automatically enrolled in the Plan at a contribution rate of four percent of eligible compensation, from which they may opt out. We match 100 percent of a participant\u2019s contributions, limited to four percent of the participant\u2019s salary. Participants are eligible to receive matching contributions after completing one year of service, in which they are immediately vested. Effective January 1, 2021, participants are eligible to receive matching contributions immediately upon enrollment in the Retirement Savings Plan. This matching contribution vests after completing one year of service. Participants are also permitted to take out a loan against their accounts subject to certain restrictions. Employees hired on or after October 1, 2010 participate in the enhanced plan in which participants receive a fixed annual contribution of four percent of eligible earnings to their Retirement Savings Plan account. Participants will continue to be eligible for company matching contributions of up to four percent of their eligible earnings and will be fully vested in the fixed annual contribution after three years of service.\nMatching and fixed annual contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to $17.9 million, $16.7 million and $16.2 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Retirement Savings Plan held 2.2 percent and 2.6 percent of our outstanding common stock.\n10. Stock and Other Compensation Plans\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nTotal stock-based compensation cost was $21.1 million, $23.9 million and $23.9 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Of this amount, $11.6 million, $12.8 million and $11.1 million was capitalized.\n1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nWe have the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which provides a comprehensive, long-term incentive compensation plan providing for discretionary awards of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and stock units to certain employees and non-employee directors of the Company and our subsidiaries. The objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the best available personnel, providing for additional performance incentives and promoting our success by providing employees with the opportunity to acquire common stock.\nWe were originally authorized to grant awards up to a maximum cumulative amount of 11.2 million shares of common stock under this plan subject to certain adjustment provisions. As of September 30, 2020, non-qualified stock options, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and stock units had been issued under this plan, and 1.3 million shares are available for future issuance through September 30, 2021.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nRestricted Stock Units Award Grants\nAs noted above, the LTIP provides for discretionary awards of restricted stock units to help attract, retain and reward employees of Atmos Energy and its subsidiaries. Certain of these awards vest based upon the passage of time and other awards vest based upon the passage of time and the achievement of specified performance targets. The fair value of the awards granted is based on the market price of our stock at the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures using our historical forfeiture rate. The associated expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. We use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements for the vesting of restricted stock units.\nEmployees who are granted time-lapse restricted stock units under our LTIP have a nonforfeitable right to dividend equivalents that are paid at the same rate and at the same time at which they are paid on shares of stock without restrictions. Time-lapse restricted stock units contain only a service condition that the employee recipients render continuous services to the Company for a period of three years from the date of grant, except for accelerated vesting in the event of death, disability, change of control of the Company or termination without cause (with certain exceptions). There are no performance conditions required to be met for employees to be vested in time-lapse restricted stock units.\nEmployees who are granted performance-based restricted stock units under our LTIP have a forfeitable right to dividend equivalents that accrue at the same rate at which they are paid on shares of stock without restrictions. Dividend equivalents on the performance-based restricted stock units are paid either in cash or in the form of shares upon the vesting of the award. Performance-based restricted stock units contain a service condition that the employee recipients render continuous services to the Company for a period of three years from the beginning of the applicable three-year performance period, except for accelerated vesting in the event of death, disability, change of control of the Company or termination without cause (with certain exceptions) and a performance condition based on a cumulative earnings per share target amount.\nThe following summarizes information regarding the restricted stock units granted under the plan during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nAs of September 30, 2020, there was $13.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units granted under the LTIP. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. The fair value of restricted stock vested during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $20.7 million, $20.5 million and $17.2 million.\nOther Plans\nDirect Stock Purchase Plan\nWe maintain a Direct Stock Purchase Plan, open to all investors, which allows participants to have all or part of their cash dividends paid quarterly in additional shares of our common stock. The minimum initial investment required to join the plan is $1,250. Direct Stock Purchase Plan participants may purchase additional shares of our common stock as often as weekly with voluntary cash payments of at least $25, up to an annual maximum of $100,000.\nEquity Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors\nWe have an Equity Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which provides non-employee directors of Atmos Energy with the opportunity to defer receipt, until retirement, of compensation for services rendered to the Company and invest deferred compensation into either a cash account or a stock account.\nOther Discretionary Compensation Plans\nWe have an annual incentive program covering substantially all employees to give each employee an opportunity to share in our financial success based on the achievement of key performance measures considered critical to achieving business\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nobjectives for a given year with minimum and maximum thresholds. The Company must meet the minimum threshold for the plan to be funded and distributed to employees. These performance measures may include earnings growth objectives, improved cash flow objectives or crucial customer satisfaction and safety results. We monitor progress towards the achievement of the performance measures throughout the year and record accruals based upon the expected payout using the best estimates available at the time the accrual is recorded. During the last several fiscal years, we have used earnings per share as our sole performance measure.\n11. Details of Selected Financial Statement Captions\nThe following tables provide additional information regarding the composition of certain financial statement captions.\nBalance Sheet\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable was comprised of the following at September 30, 2020 and 2019:\nOther current assets\nOther current assets as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of the following accounts.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment was comprised of the following as of September 30, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)\nNet property, plant and equipment includes plant acquisition adjustments of $(37.8) million and $(46.7) million at September 30, 2020 and 2019.\nGoodwill\nThe following presents our goodwill balance allocated by segment and changes in the balance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020:\n(1)\nWe annually adjust certain deferred taxes recorded in connection with an acquisition completed in fiscal 2005, which resulted in an increase to goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities of $0.6 million for fiscal 2020.\nDeferred charges and other assets\nDeferred charges and other assets as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of the following accounts.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of the following accounts.\nOther current liabilities\nOther current liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of the following accounts.\nDeferred credits and other liabilities\nDeferred credits and other liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of the following accounts.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nStatement of Comprehensive Income\nOther non-operating income (expense)\nOther non-operating income (expense) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were comprised of the following accounts.\nStatement of Cash Flows\nSupplemental disclosures of cash flow information for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(1) Cash paid during the period for interest, net of amounts capitalized was $82.3 million, $91.3 million and $106.8 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation and Environmental Matters\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. For such matters, we record liabilities when they are considered probable and estimable, based on currently available facts, our historical experience and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. While the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and a loss in excess of the amount we have accrued is possible though not reasonably estimable, it is the opinion of management that any amounts exceeding the accruals will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe maintain liability insurance for various risks associated with the operation of our natural gas pipelines and facilities, including for property damage and bodily injury. These liability insurance policies generally require us to be responsible for the first $1.0 million (self-insured retention) of each incident.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating an incident that occurred at a Dallas, Texas residence on February 23, 2018 that resulted in one fatality and injuries to four other residents. Together with the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Atmos Energy is a party to the investigation and in that capacity is working closely with the NTSB to help determine the cause of this incident.\nWe are a party to various other litigation and environmental-related matters or claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. While the results of such litigation and response actions to such environmental-related matters or claims\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\ncannot be predicted with certainty, we continue to believe the final outcome of such litigation and matters or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPurchase Commitments\nOur distribution divisions maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract.\nOur Mid-Tex Division also maintains a limited number of long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area, which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at prices indexed to natural gas trading hubs. At September 30, 2020, we were committed to purchase 59.3 Bcf within one year, 57.0 Bcf within two to three years and 0.1 Bcf beyond three years under indexed contracts. Purchases under these contracts totaled $58.5 million, $50.8 million and $57.2 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nRate Regulatory Proceedings\nAs of September 30, 2020, routine rate regulatory proceedings were in progress in some of our service areas, which are discussed in further detail above in the Business - Ratemaking Activity section.\n13. Income Taxes\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe components of income tax expense from continuing operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes a non-cash income tax benefit of $21.0 million resulting from the remeasurement of the rate at which state deferred taxes will reverse in the future as discussed below.\nReconciliations of the provision for income taxes computed at the statutory rate to the reported provisions for income taxes from continuing operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 are set forth below:\n(1)\nTax expense is calculated at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0%, 21.0%, 24.5% for the year ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. The tax effect of temporary differences that gave rise to significant components of the deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets at September 30, 2020 and 2019 are presented below:\n(1) Includes $129.0 million and $131.0 million of deferred tax liability related to goodwill as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.\nAt September 30, 2020, we had $446.9 million (tax effected) of federal net operating loss carryforwards. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset taxable income and will begin to expire in 2029. The Company also had $10.1 million of federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as of September 30, 2019, which did not expire and were fully refunded to us during fiscal 2020. In addition, the Company has $6.9 million in charitable contribution carryforwards to offset future taxable income. The Company\u2019s charitable contribution carryforwards expiration period begins in fiscal 2021.\nThe Company also has $29.6 million (tax effected) of state net operating loss carryforwards (net of $7.9 million of federal effects) and $1.8 million of state tax credits carryforwards (net of $0.5 million of federal effects). Depending on the jurisdiction in which the state net operating loss was generated, the carryforwards expiration period begins in fiscal 2021.\nWe believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards will not be realized. Due to the uncertainty of realizing a benefit from the deferred tax asset recorded for the carryforwards, a valuation allowance of $1.1 million was established for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nAt September 30, 2020, we had recorded liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits totaling $30.9 million. The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balance of our unrecognized tax benefits:\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties included within interest charges in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. During the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized approximately $0.7 million, $2.2 million and $1.6 million in interest and penalties. The Company had approximately $8.2 million, $7.9 million and $6.1 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued at September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as in various states where we have operations. We have concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal year 2009 and concluded substantially all Texas income tax matters through fiscal year 2010.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was signed into law. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nExcess Deferred Taxes\nOn June 1, 2020, the Kansas legislature passed House Bill 2585 which eliminated the assessment of state income taxes on regulated utilities. This legislation was effective for the Company on October 1, 2020. Due to the change in the Kansas state tax law and the result of a study to estimate the rate at which state deferred taxes will reverse in the future, we reduced our deferred tax liability by $32.5 million during the fiscal third quarter of 2020. We established a $12.1 million regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes that will be returned to Kansas customers. We are currently working with the Kansas Corporation Commission to determine the amortization period for this liability. We recognized a $21.0 million income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\") was signed into law. As a result of the implementation of the TCJA, we recognized a $158.8 million income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended September 30, 2018 related to a change in deferred taxes that were not related to our cost of service ratemaking. The change in deferred taxes related to our cost of service ratemaking (referred to as excess deferred taxes) was reclassified into a regulatory liability and as approved by our regulators, will be returned to ratepayers on a provisional basis over periods ranging from 15 to 46 years. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, this liability totaled $706.7 million and $726.3 million.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we received approval from regulators to update our cost of service rates to reflect the decrease in the statutory income tax rate in all of our service areas. Additionally, as of September 30, 2020, we have returned the separate regulatory liability to customers in substantially all of our service areas for the difference in taxes included in our rates that were calculated based on a 35% statutory income tax rate until new rates could be established based on the new 21% statutory income tax rate.\n14. Financial Instruments\nWe currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and to mitigate interest rate risk. Our financial instruments do not contain any credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could cause accelerated payments when our financial instruments are in net liability positions.\nAs discussed in Note 2, we report our financial instruments as risk management assets and liabilities, each of which is classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. The following table shows the fair values of our risk management assets and liabilities at September 30, 2020 and 2019.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nCommodity Risk Management Activities\nOur purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms essentially insulate our distribution segment from commodity price risk; however, our customers are exposed to the effects of volatile natural gas prices. We manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season.\nIn jurisdictions where we are permitted to mitigate commodity price risk through financial instruments, the relevant regulatory authorities may establish the level of heating season gas purchases that can be hedged. Our distribution gas supply department is responsible for executing this segment\u2019s commodity risk management activities in conformity with regulatory requirements. Historically, if the regulatory authority does not establish this level, we seek to hedge between 25 and 50 percent of anticipated heating season gas purchases using financial instruments. For the 2019-2020 heating season (generally October through March), in the jurisdictions where we are permitted to utilize financial instruments, we hedged approximately 49 percent, or approximately 19.9 Bcf of the winter flowing gas requirements at a weighted average cost of approximately $2.84 per Mcf. We have not designated these financial instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk Management Activities\nIn fiscal 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the Treasury yield component associated with $500 million of a planned issuance of unsecured senior notes in fiscal 2021 at 0.69%; these swaps were settled in September 2020 with a net payment of $4.4 million. On October 1, 2020, the notes were issued as planned.\nAdditionally, in fiscal 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the Treasury yield component associated with $450 million of a planned issuance of unsecured senior notes in fiscal 2022 at 1.33%, $300 million of a planned issuance of unsecured senior notes in fiscal 2023 at 1.36% and $300 million of a planned issuance of unsecured senior notes in fiscal 2025 at 1.35%, which we designated as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements were executed.\nQuantitative Disclosures Related to Financial Instruments\nThe following tables present detailed information concerning the impact of financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheet and statements of comprehensive income.\nAs of September 30, 2020, our financial instruments were comprised of both long and short commodity positions. A long position is a contract to purchase the commodity, while a short position is a contract to sell the commodity. As of September 30, 2020, we had 18,191 MMcf of net long commodity contracts outstanding. These contracts have not been designated as hedges.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nFinancial Instruments on the Balance Sheet\nThe following tables present the fair value and balance sheet classification of our financial instruments as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. The gross amounts of recognized assets and liabilities are netted within our consolidated balance sheets to the extent that we have netting arrangements with the counterparties. However, as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, no gross amounts and no cash collateral were netted within our consolidated balance sheet.\nImpact of Financial Instruments on the Statement of Comprehensive Income\nCash Flow Hedges\nAs discussed above, the interest rate agreements we executed in prior years were designated as cash flow hedges when those agreements were executed. The net loss on settled interest rate agreements reclassified from AOCI into interest charges on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $5.5 million, $3.9 million and $2.4 million.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the gains and losses arising from hedging transactions that were recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The amounts included in the table below exclude gains and losses arising from ineffectiveness because these amounts are immediately recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.\nDeferred gains (losses) recorded in AOCI associated with our interest rate agreements are recognized in earnings as they are amortized over the terms of the underlying debt instruments. As of September 30, 2020, we had $114.5 million of net realized losses in AOCI associated with our interest rate agreements. The following amounts, net of deferred taxes, represent the expected recognition in earnings of the deferred net losses recorded in AOCI associated with our interest rate agreements, based upon the fair values of these agreements at the date of settlement. The remaining amortization periods for these settled amounts extend through fiscal 2049. However, the table below does not include the expected recognition in earnings of our outstanding interest rate agreements as those financial instruments have not yet settled.\nFinancial Instruments Not Designated as Hedges\nAs discussed above, commodity contracts which are used in our distribution segment are not designated as hedges. However, there is no earnings impact on our distribution segment as a result of the use of these financial instruments because the gains and losses arising from the use of these financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue. Accordingly, the impact of these financial instruments is excluded from this presentation.\n15. Fair Value Measurements\nWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable at carrying value, which substantially approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. For other financial assets and liabilities, we primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information to minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements when determining fair value. The methods used to determine fair value for our assets and liabilities are fully described in Note 2.\nFair value measurements also apply to the valuation of our pension and post-retirement plan assets. The fair value of these assets is presented in Note 9.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nQuantitative Disclosures\nFinancial Instruments\nThe classification of our fair value measurements requires judgment regarding the degree to which market data are observable or corroborated by observable market data. The following tables summarize, by level within the fair value hierarchy, our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. As required under authoritative accounting literature, assets and liabilities are categorized in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n(1)\nOur Level 2 measurements consist of over-the-counter options and swaps, which are valued using a market-based approach in which observable market prices are adjusted for criteria specific to each instrument, such as the strike price, notional amount or basis differences, municipal and corporate bonds, which are valued based on the most recent available quoted market prices and money market funds which are valued at cost.\n(2)\nOur investments in bonds are considered available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with current accounting guidance.\nAt September 30, 2020 and 2019, the amortized cost of our available-for-sale debt securities was $32.6 million and $31.7 million. At September 30, 2020 we maintained investments in bonds that have contractual maturity dates ranging from October 2020 through May 2023.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOther Fair Value Measures\nIn addition to the financial instruments above, we have several financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt, which are recorded at carrying value. The nonfinancial assets and liabilities include asset retirement obligations and pension and post-retirement plan assets. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, we consider carrying value to materially approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.\nOur long-term debt is recorded at carrying value. The fair value of our long-term debt, excluding finance leases, is determined using third party market value quotations, which are considered Level 1 fair value measurements for debt instruments with a recent, observable trade or Level 2 fair value measurements for debt instruments where fair value is determined using the most recent available quoted market price. The carrying value of our finance leases materially approximates fair value. The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of our long-term debt, excluding finances leases, debt issuance costs and original issue premium or discount, as of September 30, 2020:\n16. Concentration of Credit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer fails to perform its contractual obligations. We engage in transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial, commercial, residential and municipal energy consumers. These transactions principally occur in the southern and midwestern regions of the United States. We believe that this geographic concentration does not contribute significantly to our overall exposure to credit risk. Credit risk associated with trade accounts receivable for the distribution segment is mitigated by the large number of individual customers and the diversity in our customer base. The credit risk for our other segment is not significant.\n17. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nSummarized unaudited quarterly financial data is presented below. The sum of net income per share by quarter may not equal the net income per share for the fiscal year due to variations in the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing such amounts. Our businesses are seasonal due to weather conditions in our service areas. For further information on its effects on quarterly results, see the \u201cResults of Operations\u201d discussion included in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section herein.\nATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nITEM 9.",

Based on this evaluation, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us, including our consolidated entities, in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, including a reasonable level of assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2020, in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nErnst & Young LLP has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2020 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated November 13, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nDallas, Texas\nNovember 13, 2020\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe did not make any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Act) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.",
