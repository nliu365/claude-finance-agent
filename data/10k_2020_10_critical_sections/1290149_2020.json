Our main focus is the development of momelotinib, an investigational agent for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Currently, momelotinib is in a global Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with myelofibrosis, called the MOMENTUM study, that if successful will be registration enabling. At its completion, approximately 1,000 myelofibrosis patients will have received momelotinib, and several of our clinical trial patients remain on treatment more than 10 years later.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, we acquired momelotinib from Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead), which had completed several late-stage trials of the drug candidate in patients with myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is characterized by progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia and currently approved JAK inhibitor therapies, ruxolitinib and fedratinib, can induce or further exacerbate this myelosuppression, limiting their use in first line treatment and resulting in a population of second line patients who are no longer able to benefit from such therapies. Momelotinib is a novel, orally-bioavailable JAK1 (Janus kinase 1), JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and ACVR1 (Activin A receptor type 1) inhibitor with a differentiated mechanism of action, enabling it to potentially address all three hallmarks of disease in myelofibrosis: anemia of inflammation, constitutional symptoms and enlarged spleen.\nIn December 2018, we reported new data for momelotinib collated from the two completed SIMPLIFY Phase 3 clinical trials and a translational biology study in transfusion dependent patients with myelofibrosis. Data from the latter study were also concurrently presented in a poster at the 60th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition in San Diego, California. We reported aggregated transfusion independence responses from more than 150 intermediate and high-risk transfusion dependent myelofibrosis patients demonstrating robust and consistent response rates within and across the clinical studies. More than 44% of these patients became transfusion free for at least 12 weeks and nearly 50% were transfusion independent for at least 8 weeks.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we announced that we had obtained regulatory clarity with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning the design of a Phase 3 clinical trial intended to support potential registration of momelotinib. We also announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation to momelotinib for the treatment of patients with intermediate/high-risk myelofibrosis who have previously received a JAK inhibitor.\nFollowing receipt of this clarity, we announced the design of the MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial in myelofibrosis, which we subsequently launched in the fourth quarter of 2019. MOMENTUM is a randomized double-blind trial designed to enroll 180 myelofibrosis patients who are symptomatic and anemic and have been treated previously with a JAK inhibitor. The Primary Endpoint of the trial is the Total Symptom Score (TSS) response rate of momelotinib compared to danazol at Week 24 (99% power; p-value < 0.05). Danazol has been selected as an appropriate treatment comparator given its use to ameliorate anemia in myelofibrosis patients, as recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines. Patients are being randomized 2:1 to receive either momelotinib or danazol. After 24 weeks of treatment, patients on danazol are being allowed to crossover to receive momelotinib.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported new analyses of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion data from SIMPLIFY-1, a double-blind Phase 3 trial of momelotinib head-to-head versus ruxolitinib in JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve patients, which were presented in a poster by Dr. Ruben Mesa, Director of the Mays Cancer Center, home to UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center, at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida. These analyses demonstrated that patients who received momelotinib had significantly decreased transfusion requirements compared to those treated with ruxolitinib, including an odds ratio of nearly 10 for receiving no transfusions during the 24-week study period. Transfusion dependency and moderate to severe anemia are critical negative prognostic factors for overall survival in myelofibrosis.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, at the 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Virtual Congress, we reported favorable Long-Term Safety and Dose Intensity data for momelotinib from more than 550 patients across the two previously conducted SIMPLIFY Phase 3 studies and their subsequent ongoing extended treatment periods. More than 90 SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2 patients continued to receive momelotinib for 3.5 years or longer. These data were presented in posters by Professor Claire Harrison, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom, and Dr. Vikas Gupta, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada. The key findings were:\n\u2022\nConsistent with prior data, and reflecting momelotinib's differentiated pharmacological profile, our new long-term safety analyses continue to show a rapid and sustained increase in hemoglobin levels during momelotinib therapy, in contrast to the significant decrease in hemoglobin for patients receiving ruxolitinib. Patients treated with momelotinib also experienced significantly higher mean platelet counts compared to those receiving ruxolitinib. Importantly, patients who switched from ruxolitinib to momelotinib also achieved a sustained improvement in hemoglobin in both studies, and platelets in SIMPLIFY-1. In addition to an absence of significant rates of high-grade hematological toxicities, long-term tolerability was favorable with no new safety signals or evidence of cumulative toxicity.\n\u2022\nMomelotinib's safety profile and durable benefits facilitated sustained dose intensity across the continuum of JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve and previously JAK inhibitor treated myelofibrosis patients. While the starting doses for ruxolitinib were often attenuated due to low platelets, further reductions in dose intensity were also commonly required for ruxolitinib. In contrast, momelotinib was initiated at full dose for all subjects enrolled to the SIMPLIFY studies and high dose intensity was maintained in the majority over extended durations. Patients who switched from ruxolitinib to momelotinib saw an immediate and sustained improvement in dose intensity.\n\u2022\nThe data from the two interrelated presentations suggest that the favorable effect on hemoglobin and platelets allows momelotinib to be initiated at full dose intensity and maintained for the majority of patients at full dose intensity over extended durations while retaining a favorable long-term safety profile. Notably, some patients continued to receive momelotinib 10 years after enrolling in the initial momelotinib Phase 2 trials while 90 Phase 3 SIMPLIFY patients who enrolled into those trials 4 to 6 years ago continued to receive momelotinib. We believe the dosing and safety profile may contribute to momelotinib\u2019s potential ability to provide sustained benefits over extended durations.\nMost recently, we released updated analyses from the previously completed Phase 3 SIMPLIFY studies of momelotinib at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2020, including overall survival data as well as efficacy data for momelotinib compared to ruxolitinib in patients with low platelet levels. The overall survival data received an oral presentation by Dr. Srdan Verstovsek of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, USA; efficacy data by platelet strata were presented in a poster by Dr. Jean-Jacques Kiladjian, Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France. Key findings were:\n\u2022\nRobust overall survival was observed in both JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve and previously ruxolitinib treated patients. Sustained transfusion independence was observed with extended momelotinib treatment, and the median duration of TI in the momelotinib arm has not been reached after more than three years of follow up. We believe these data, in combination with previously reported safety data, further highlight where momelotinib may be a viable treatment option for myelofibrosis patients, including those who are not ideal candidates for currently approved therapies.\n\u2022\nThe retrospective analysis of the two Phase 3 SIMPLIFY studies demonstrate that the relative benefit-risk profile of momelotinib and ruxolitinib is influenced by baseline platelet count. In SIMPLIFY-1, momelotinib achieved substantially higher Transfusion Independence (TI) and splenic response rates and had a similar symptomatic response relative to ruxolitinib in patients whose platelet count at baseline was <150 x 109/L. For patients whose platelet count was 150 - 300 x 109/L, momelotinib achieved a higher TI response rate and generally similar splenic and symptom response rates. In patients with platelet counts >300 x 109/L, ruxolitinib achieved higher splenic and symptom response rates than momelotinib, and the TI rate remained higher with momelotinib. These updated analyses complement previous findings that demonstrate the ability to initiate and maintain near-maximal momelotinib dose intensity regardless of baseline platelet count, suggesting that this durable dosing contributes to its efficacy profile.\nDuring 2020, we continued to operationalize the MOMENTUM trial on a global basis, and we anticipate closing screening in the first half of 2021 and remain on track to complete enrollment in mid-2021. Top-line data are currently anticipated in the first half of 2022 and, if the data are positive, we anticipate filing for regulatory approval of momelotinib in the second half of 2022. Due to the recent global outbreak of COVID-19, our clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected, and we are likely to experience delays in anticipated timelines and milestones, which will be difficult to predict until we have more visibility on the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential institution of additional public health orders. We have experienced and may continue to experience some delays in planned site initiations and activations and may experience future delays in overall enrollment.\nWe believe that our current resources will be sufficient to execute on our development strategy for momelotinib into the second half of 2022, subject to the potential impact of COVID-19. We are also starting to explore non-dilutive options that could provide additional capital to support our North American commercialization strategy.\nOur portfolio also includes SRA737, a selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), an emerging target for the treatment of cancer which has a key role in the DNA Damage Response (DDR). In November 2020, we entered into an amendment to the License Agreement with CRT Pioneer Fund (CPF) to allow for the potential future clinical development of SRA737.\nWe wholly own momelotinib, subject to future milestone payments and royalties, and retain the global commercialization rights to SRA737.\nOur Lead Product Candidate - Momelotinib\nMyelofibrosis\nMyelofibrosis is a disorder involving the stem-cells that give rise to blood cells, and is driven by molecular abnormalities that activate the JAK-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. The Janus kinases (JAKs) play a central role in the regulation of blood cell production, controlling survival, proliferation, and differentiation of progenitor cells as well as the function of mature cells. Abnormal activation of the JAK-STAT pathway is central to the development of myelofibrosis by driving proliferation, inflammation, fibrosis, and progression of disease.\nThe three cardinal disease manifestations of myelofibrosis are (1) progressive anemia, often in association with thrombocytopenia (deficiency of platelets in the blood) or other cytopenias (blood cell deficiencies); (2) constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats, fever, cachexia (wasting), bone pain, pruritus (itching), and weight loss; and (3) organ enlargement, principally of the spleen and less often the liver, due to these organs attempting to produce blood cells, which can cause commonly associated symptoms such as abdominal distension and pain, early satiety, dyspnea (labored breathing), and diarrhea. The median survival for all patients with myelofibrosis is about six years but is considerably worse for intermediate 2- and high-risk patients at 4 years and 2.25 years, respectively. Besides causing disease-related morbidity, myelofibrosis may result in early death from leukemic progression, which can occur in about 20% of patients, and complications arising from progressive bone marrow failure, portal or pulmonary hypertension, infections, clotting, bleeding, and cardiovascular complications.\nMyelofibrosis is a relatively rare condition with an incidence of 0.1 to 1 per 100,000 individuals per year, and a prevalence of 6 per 100,000 person-years because of its chronic nature and disabling course. It is estimated that 18,000 patients are living with myelofibrosis in the United States, and there are up to 40,000 patients globally. Median age at diagnosis is 67 years. Myelofibrosis may occur de novo as primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or may arise from a preexisting myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), including primarily polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocytosis (ET).\nImportance of Anemia in Myelofibrosis\nAnemia is a cardinal feature of myelofibrosis, and RBC transfusion dependence is a hallmark of the late-stage disease. Within a year of diagnosis, 45% of patients with myelofibrosis are already RBC transfusion dependent and eventually, nearly all will develop transfusion dependence.\nTransfusion dependence is a critical negative prognostic factor for survival for patients with myelofibrosis. Transfusions are associated with both acute and chronic health risks, and they place a significant burden on both the patient and the health care system. Severe anemia and transfusion dependence are independent predictors of poor prognosis and are inversely correlated with quality of life. Conversely, response to anemia-targeted therapies has been associated with improvement in quality of life. The prognostic effect of anemia was recently demonstrated in 1,109 consecutive PMF patients at the Mayo Clinic, 86% of whom presented with some degree of anemia. Even mild anemia impaired survival, while severe anemia (defined as Hgb level of < 8 g/dL or transfusion dependence) was associated with > 1.5-fold increase in risk of death compared with moderate anemia (Hgb level of 8-10 g/dL).\nExisting approaches for the management of myelofibrosis associated anemia include transfusion, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with low erythropoietin levels, corticosteroids, androgens (including danazol), immunomodulators, and splenectomy. Each of these treatments is described by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) as minimally effective.\nMomelotinib - A Potent and Selective JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 Inhibitor\nMomelotinib is a potent, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1, under development for treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. Momelotinib was discovered by Cytopia Research, which commenced an initial Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States in 2009. Cytopia was acquired by YM BioSciences, Inc. in 2010, which continued clinical development of the compound, before its own acquisition by Gilead in 2013. Amongst other clinical studies, Gilead conducted two registration-track Phase 3 trials in subjects with myelofibrosis, GS-US-352-0101 (SIMPLIFY-1) and GS-US-352-1214 (SIMPLIFY-2). In August 2018, we acquired the momelotinib program from Gilead and assumed the role of IND sponsor in September 2018 with the intent to continue development of momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Several members of our senior management team were previously executives at Cytopia and/or YM BioSciences and led the early development of momelotinib.\nFollowing our acquisition of the program, we conducted a comprehensive review of data from the two Phase 3 trials of momelotinib, versus ruxolitinib (SIMPLIFY-1) and best available therapy (BAT) (SIMPLIFY-2), as well as GS-US-352-1672, a Phase 2, open-label, translational biology trial of momelotinib in transfusion-dependent subjects with myelofibrosis. In aggregate, our analyses across a variety of datasets show consistent benefit in the three cardinal disease manifestations of myelofibrosis across a spectrum of intermediate-high risk patients with myelofibrosis, both JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve and previously JAK inhibitor-exposed: namely, (1) anemia and transfusion dependency, (2) constitutional symptoms, and (3) enlarged spleen, consistent with the compound\u2019s differentiated inhibition of JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1. Although SIMPLIFY-1 met its primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior spleen volume reduction, it did not meet its key secondary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior reduction in total symptom score; and although SIMPLIFY-2 did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of superior reduction in spleen volume, it did meet its key secondary efficacy endpoint of superior reduction in total symptom score. In both SIMPLIFY studies, additional secondary endpoints related to transfusion independence rate, transfusion dependence rate, and rate of red blood cell transfusions all favored momelotinib over control and supported the potential for momelotinib to provide meaningful anemia benefits. As such, we have determined that there is substantial clinical justification for further development of momelotinib.\nAmong the JAK-inhibitor class, momelotinib uniquely inhibits JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1. All three targets contribute to disease manifestations of myelofibrosis in complex and overlapping ways. The dominant roles for each in driving the various disease manifestations include: JAK1, abnormal cytokine production and immune dysregulation; JAK2, clonal myeloid proliferation; and ACVR1, anemia. Evidence suggests that momelotinib can provide an array of differentiated and compelling anemia-related clinical benefits, while also providing symptomatic and splenic benefits clinically comparable to the approved standard-of-care, ruxolitinib. Specifically, via inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2, momelotinib is uniquely positioned as the only JAK-inhibitor demonstrated to provide comparable splenic benefit when compared directly to ruxolitinib in the JAK inhibitor treatment-na\u00efve setting, while Phase 3 data strongly suggest the potential for momelotinib to provide substantial symptom benefit for both JAK-inhibitor treatment-na\u00efve and exposed patients with myelofibrosis. In addition, momelotinib induces robust, clinically meaningful and consistent anemia benefits, likely via inhibition of ACVR1 and JAK1, as demonstrated in the two momelotinib Phase 3 trials and in the Phase 2 translational biology trial (GS-US-352-1672) in transfusion-dependent patients.\nMyelofibrosis-associated anemia is dependent on a number of factors and involves the hyperactivation of two parallel signal transduction pathways that drive production of the peptide hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron metabolism, and elevated levels in myelofibrosis perturbs iron homeostasis and exacerbates anemia. The principle pathway directing hepcidin expression involves activation of ACVR1, whereas a secondary pathway increases hepcidin in response to inflammation and JAK-STAT signaling. Momelotinib directly inhibits ACVR1, JAK1 and JAK2 to effectively limit hepcidin production. This unique profile induces a dose-dependent decrease in serum hepcidin, restoring iron homeostasis and alleviating anemia.\nIn a nonclinical anemia model, momelotinib treatment increased circulating plasma iron, RBC production, and Hgb levels consistent with the observed reduction in inflammatory cytokine and hepcidin levels associated with inhibition of JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1.This effect of momelotinib was further validated by data from trial GS-US-352-1672 in an advanced, transfusion-dependent myelofibrosis population in which 34% and 39% of patients achieved transfusion independence for at least 12 and 8 weeks, respectively. Median plasma hepcidin levels declined acutely after momelotinib dosing and chronically over the entire 24-week dosing period, suggesting momelotinib induced a sustained reduction of both predose (basal) and postdose levels of hepcidin. In an exploratory post-hoc analysis, a substantial reduction in transfusion frequency was also observed in subjects who did not achieve complete transfusion independence.\nSimilarly, substantially higher rates of transfusion independence and lower rates of transfusion dependency were observed in momelotinib-treated subjects compared with ruxolitinib or BAT-treated subjects in the SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2 pivotal trials. In an exploratory aggregate analysis including 152 transfusion dependent patients treated with momelotinib across the SIMPLIFY-1, SIMPLIFY-2, and GS-US-352-1672 trials, the combined 8- and 12-week transfusion independence response rates across this continuum of JAK-inhibitor-na\u00efve and exposed, intermediate- and high-risk myelofibrosis patients, were 48.7% and 44.1%, respectively. The rate of transfusion independence in transfusion-dependent subjects, along with other anemia benefits, were broadly consistent across these trials, and are consistent with the empirical findings of a pronounced anemia benefit observed in initial Phase 1/2 momelotinib clinical studies.\nIn addition, there is extensive evidence of momelotinib\u2019s sustained positive effects on hemoglobin (Hgb) and other anemia endpoints. A robust and long-lasting increase in Hgb was observed in the GS-US-352-1672 trial, which enrolled only transfusion-dependent subjects. A similar observation was noted in the JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve SIMPLIFY-1 trial, where a rapid and sustained increase in Hgb was observed in subjects randomized to momelotinib, which contrasted with the acute and profound reduction in Hgb by treatment with the standard-of-care, ruxolitinib. Notably, subjects who crossed over to momelotinib treatment following 24 weeks of ruxolitinib therapy experienced a rapid and substantive increase in Hgb, ultimately achieving sustained Hgb levels that exceeded those observed in the pretreatment baseline period.\nIn totality, over 1,200 subjects have been treated with momelotinib across more than 20 clinical studies, with over 820 myelofibrosis patients treated to date. Uniquely among the JAK inhibitor class, this substantive body of clinical data has demonstrated consistent and reproducible therapeutic benefits for momelotinib across all three hallmarks of myelofibrosis, anemia, enlarged spleen and symptoms. In general, momelotinib has proven to be generally well tolerated, with certain patients having received continuous daily dosing of momelotinib for more than 10 years, indicative of momelotinib\u2019s potential to provide long-term tolerability and sustained benefit. In the randomized phases of SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2, the most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events for subjects treated with momelotinib were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, headache, asthenia and nausea. The most commonly reported Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were anemia, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, pneumonia and cardiac failure. These SAEs include events assessed as both related and unrelated to momelotinib and each occurred in < 4% of subjects.\nMomelotinib - Next Steps\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we launched the MOMENTUM clinical trial for patients with myelofibrosis. The randomized double-blind global Phase 3 trial is designed to confirm the efficacy of momelotinib on myelofibrosis symptoms, transfusion independence and splenomegaly, as compared to danazol. The trial is targeting enrollment of 180 myelofibrosis patients who are symptomatic, anemic and have been treated previously with a JAK inhibitor. We anticipate reporting top-line data from the trial in the first half of 2022. Data from MOMENTUM, along with data from more than 820 myelofibrosis patients previously treated with momelotinib, will form the basis of the global registration strategy for momelotinib.\nOur DDR Candidate - SRA737\nSRA737, a Potent, Highly Selective, Orally Bioavailable Chk1 Inhibitor\nSRA737 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1, an emerging target for the treatment of cancer which has a key role in the DNA Damage Response. SRA737 was investigated in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials that were initiated in the third quarter of 2016 in the United Kingdom under a Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA). SRA737 was licensed to us in September 2016 and in January 2017, we successfully transferred sponsorship of the trials to Sierra.\nCheckpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a serine-threonine kinase and master regulator of cell cycle progression and the DNA Damage Response (DDR) replication stress response. One of the hallmarks of cancer is genomic instability. A major source of genomic instability in certain tumors arises as a consequence of dysregulated cell cycle checkpoints and aberrant DNA replication, resulting in high replication stress (RS), which is manifested by stalled replication forks and associated DNA damage. Chk1 regulates multiple cell-cycle phases, temporarily inhibiting the progression of cell replication and division in order to ensure proper replication of the genome and repair of collapsed or damaged replication forks. Chk1 stabilizes stalled replication forks, manages origin firing to avoid further replication stress, and mediates DNA repair via homologous recombination in the event of fork collapse. Tumors with high RS become reliant on Chk1 to mitigate the potentially catastrophic consequences of excess genomic instability. As such, Chk1 represents a promising therapeutic target in cancers with high RS, as inhibiting Chk1 drives excessive genomic instability which can result in replication catastrophe and tumor cell death.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we reported preliminary efficacy and safety data from these two trials at the 2019 ASCO Annual meeting. We also announced plans to prioritize our resources on the development of momelotinib and that we would be launching a campaign exploring non-dilutive strategic options to support any future continued development of SRA737. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced an amendment to the license agreement with CPF to allow for the potential future clinical development of SRA737.\nSRA737-01 Phase 1/2 Monotherapy Trial\nThis signal-seeking Phase 1/2 study (NCT02797964) was designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of continuous, oral daily dosing of SRA737, as well as to survey a broad range of cancer indications and genetic contexts in the expansion phase, in order to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity and delineate potential genetic signatures and/or tumor indications that might warrant additional therapeutic investigation.\nAt the 2019 ASCO Annual meeting, we reported preliminary efficacy and safety data from this trial. Evidence of anti-tumor activity was observed in subjects with high grade serous ovarian carcinomas, colorectal, prostate and non-small cell lung cancers; no RECIST partial responses or complete responses were confirmed, but several noteworthy tumor reductions were recorded.\nSRA737-02 Phase 1/2 Low-Dose Gemcitabine Combination Trial\nExtensive preclinical data, as well as emerging clinical data, support the synergistic interaction between Chk1 inhibition and gemcitabine. Gemcitabine profoundly depletes DNA replication building blocks, and targets proliferating cells by inducing replication stress through induction of stalled replication forks and double-strand breaks. Low concentrations of gemcitabine cause a prolonged cell cycle S-phase and induce hallmarks of replication stress without inducing overt cytotoxicity. The critical role of Chk1 in mediating cellular responses to replication stress affords the opportunity to combine SRA737 with sub-therapeutic concentrations of the replication stress-inducing agent gemcitabine.\nThis signal-seeking Phase 1/2 study (NCT02797977) was designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of SRA737 in combination with sub-therapeutic, low dose gemcitabine (LDG), as well as to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of SRA737 potentiated by LDG in tumors with genetic alterations predicted to confer increased intrinsic RS and Chk1i sensitivity. Relative to standard-of-care, gemcitabine doses tested were approximately 10-25% of a standard chemotherapeutic dose.\nAt the 2019 ASCO Annual meeting, we reported preliminary efficacy and safety data from this trial. Overall, Partial Responses were observed in six subjects and 41 subjects had a best response of Stable Disease (SD); durable SD lasting \u2265 4 months was recorded in 32 subjects and was observed in all expansion cohorts. The combination of SRA737+LDG was generally well tolerated. Following ASCO 2019, we announced plans to prioritize our resources on the development of momelotinib and that we would be launching a campaign exploring non-dilutive strategic options to support any future continued development of SRA737. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced an amendment to the license agreement with CPF to allow for the potential future clinical development of SRA737.\nAsset Purchase Agreement\nIn August 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Gilead whereby we acquired worldwide rights to the pharmaceutical product momelotinib, an investigational orally-bioavailable JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 inhibitor together with all related intellectual property rights and certain other related assets. Pursuant to the agreement, we made a one-time upfront payment of $3.0 million in August 2018. In October 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement in which we agreed to issue, subject to certain conditions, shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock to Gilead in consideration for meaningfully reduced royalty rates and elimination of a near term milestone payment in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the amended agreement, milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $190.0 million may become payable to Gilead upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestone events and we are now required to pay Gilead low double-digit to high-teens percent tiered combined royalties based upon net sales. In January 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Gilead, pursuant to which we issued to Gilead 725,283 shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase 725,283 shares of common stock at a price per share of $13.20.\nLicense Agreements\nCRT Pioneer Fund LP License Agreement\nIn September 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with CRT Pioneer Fund LP (CPF) for worldwide rights, know-how and materials to develop SRA737, a small molecule inhibitor targeting Checkpoint kinase 1, an emerging target to treat cancer which has a key role in the DNA Damage Response. Pursuant to the agreement, we made a one-time upfront payment of $7.0 million to CPF in October 2016 and paid $2.0 million to CPF in January 2017 for the successful transfer of two ongoing Phase I clinical trials. Pursuant to the original license agreement, additional milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $319.5 million may have become payable to CPF upon the achievement of certain milestones. In November 2020, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with CPF, which amended the terms and reduced the amounts of certain future milestones. Pursuant to the amended agreement, future milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $290.0 million may become payable to CPF upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, including a milestone payment of $2.0 million upon the dosing of the first patient of the first trial of SRA737 following the effective date of the amendment. In addition, we are required to pay CPF, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on the net sales of any product successfully developed until the later of (i) the date when such licensed product is no longer covered by a valid patent claim within the licensed intellectual property, (ii) the expiration of any data, marketing or other statutory exclusivity rights covering the licensed product, or (iii) a specified period after the first commercial sale of the licensed product. Such royalties will be reduced on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis under certain conditions, including if certain generic competition exists in such country, or if we are required to pay royalties to third parties in order to develop or commercialize the licensed product.\nThe license agreement will expire on the date of expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to CPF. Either party may terminate the license agreement if the other party materially breaches the license agreement, subject to certain cure provisions, and CPF may terminate the license agreement in certain limited circumstances as described in the license agreement. The license agreement may also be terminated at any time by us upon 90 days\u2019 prior written notice to CPF.\nCarna Biosciences, Inc. Collaboration Agreement\nIn May 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Carna Biosciences, Inc. (Carna) for worldwide rights to develop and commercialize SRA141, a small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting Cdc7. In exchange for this exclusive right, we paid Carna an upfront payment of $0.9 million in June 2016. In June 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Carna effectively terminating the license agreement. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, Carna paid an upfront fee of $0.3 million for the exclusive worldwide rights for SRA141 and other transition services. In addition, we may be entitled to single-digit royalties on product sales, on a product-by-product basis, and low to mid-teen profit share on royalty and non-royalty income.\nThe collaboration agreement will expire on the date of expiration of Carna\u2019s obligation to pay royalties to us. We may terminate the collaboration agreement if Carna materially breaches the agreement, subject to certain cure provisions. The collaboration agreement may also be terminated at any time by Carna upon 30 days\u2019 prior written notice to us.\nIntellectual Property\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for momelotinib and SRA737 and future product candidates, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our strategy is to seek to protect our proprietary position and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing patent applications related to our proprietary technology and product candidates in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position.\nWe have acquired all rights to patent portfolios directed to compositions of matter and methods of use related to momelotinib and other JAK 1/2 and ACVR1 inhibitors. As of December 31, 2020, these rights included three issued U.S. patents comprising claims directed to compositions and analogs of momelotinib and methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrotic indications as a single agent. Two of these patents will expire in 2028 while the third patent will expire in 2030, absent any extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also include 53 issued foreign patents and one pending foreign patent application in 48 jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, several countries in Europe, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia and others comprising claims directed to compositions of momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrotic indications as a single agent. These foreign patents, and any patent issuing from the pending foreign patent application, are expected to expire in 2028, absent any extension. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one issued U.S. utility patent and one reissued U.S. utility patent, and one pending reissue application comprising claims directed to different polymorph and salt forms of momelotinib, and methods of their use for the treatment of myelofibrotic indications. These patents will expire in 2035, absent any extension. Note that for issued U.S. patents, up to five years of patent term extension is available for a single patent directed to the composition of momelotinib, bringing the possible patent exclusivity in the U.S. out to 2040. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included 46 issued foreign patents, and 14 pending foreign patent applications in 52 jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, several countries in Europe, Hong-Kong, India, Israel, New Zealand, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan comprising claims directed to different polymorph and salt forms of momelotinib. These foreign patents, and any patent issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2035, absent any extension. Note that for issued European patents, up to five years of term extension is available via a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) for a single patent directed to the composition of momelotinib, bringing the possible patent exclusivity in Europe out to 2040. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included four issued foreign patents in four jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa comprising claims directed to methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of anemia. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one issued U.S. patent comprising claims directed to methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of ACVR1-mediated diseases. This U.S. patent will expire in 2037, absent any extensions. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application, and two foreign pending application comprising claims directed to platelet count-agnostic methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis. We have filed and will continue to file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of momelotinib as they develop.\nWe have exclusively licensed CPF\u2019s rights to patents owned by Cancer Research Technology (CPF), a subsidiary of Cancer Research UK (CRUK), directed to compositions of matter and methods of use related to SRA737 and other Chk1 inhibitors. As of December 31, 2020, these rights included two issued U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent application comprising claims directed to compositions of SRA737 and methods of using SRA737 for the treatment of cancer indications as a single agent, or in combination with a DNA damaging agent. The two issued U.S. patents and any patents issuing from the pending U.S. utility application are expected to expire in 2033, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included 27 issued foreign patents and 6 pending foreign patent applications in 27 foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe and Japan comprising claims directed to compositions of SRA737 and methods of using SRA737 for the treatment of cancer indications as a single agent, or in combination with a DNA damaging agent. These foreign patents, and any patents issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2033, absent any extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included, one pending U.S. application and 4 pending foreign applications comprising claims directed to biomarkers and patient selection when using SRA737 to treat cancer indications. Any patents issuing from these pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2038, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending U.S. application and 8 pending foreign applications comprising claims directed to methods of using SRA737 in combination with PARP inhibitors for inhibiting tumor reduction. Any patents issuing from these pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2038, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending U.S. application and 7 pending foreign applications comprising claims directed to methods of using SRA737 as a monotherapy or in combination therapy to treat cancer indications. Any patents issuing from these pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2039, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application filed by the Company and The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center comprising claims directed to methods of using SRA737 to treat cancer indications. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application comprising claims directed to methods of using SRA737 in the treatment of cancer associated with an intermediate mutational burden (TMB), or genetic abnormality in one or more particular genes associated with replicative stress. We have filed and will continue to file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of SRA737 as they develop.\nThe term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent\u2019s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or other foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product candidate and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.\nAs with other oncology companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Our issued patents and any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before momelotinib and SRA737 or any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.\nIn addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our scientific advisors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with a third party.\nCompetition\nThe hematology and oncology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies that are available for the indication or indications for which they are approved and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nTo our knowledge, there are currently two approved myelofibrosis drugs that specifically rely on JAK inhibition, ruxolitinib, marketed by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi\u00ae in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi in the rest of the world and fedratinib, marketed by Celgene Corporation as Inrebic\u00ae in the United States. Fedratinib was also recently approved in Europe. In addition, there is one additional JAK inhibitor competitor in clinical development, at a similar state of development or more advanced than us. CTI Biopharma Corporation is developing pacritinib, for a subset of myelofibrosis patients with platelet counts less than 50,000/uL commenced its rolling NDA submission in October 2020. However, to our knowledge, there are no drugs that target JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 on the market, nor in development. Other competitors developing myelofibrosis therapeutics include Acceleron, Constellation Pharma, AbbVie, Kartos and Incyte. Celgene and Acceleron are developing luspatercept in a Phase 3 clinical trial for myelofibrosis. Constellation Pharma is developing pelabresib (CPI-0610), a BET inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical trial in combiniation with ruxolitinib. AbbVie announced two Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with ruxolitinib for JAKi na\u00efve and previously JAKi treated patients. Kartos announced clinical trial plans for KRT-232, a MDM2 inhibitor for JAKi relapsed or refractory MF patients. Incyte launched Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate parsaclisib, in combination with ruxolitinib. In addition, there are several Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials being conducted in myelofibrosis by various companies, including a Phase 2 study of a deuterated form of momelotinib being run by Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals in China. Several additional companies are advancing assets in the early stages of development potentially for the myelofibrosis market. If momelotinib is approved, it will compete with existing therapies for the indication or indications for which it is approved. While we believe that momelotinib may have the ability to provide an anemia benefit in addition to treating the other manifestations of myelofibrosis, which we believe is unique within the JAK inhibitor class of agents, the market for momelotinib is competitive, and physicians and other prescribers may not recommend or prescribe momelotinib over other competing products.\nTo our knowledge, there are no approved drugs that specifically target Chk1 on the market, but there are a number of competitors in clinical development, at a similar stage of development or more advanced than us. To our knowledge, Esperas Pharma is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of an oral Chk1 inhibitor as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. There are also preclinical programs focused on developing Chk1 inhibitors. If SRA737 is approved, it will compete with existing therapies and currently marketed drugs for the indication or indications for which it is approved.\nMany of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the hematology and oncology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs.\nManufacturing\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture and supply of preclinical study and clinical trial materials in relation to our lead product candidate, momelotinib, including materials for any combination trials that we may undertake, and any future potential product candidates that we may develop for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if momelotinib receives marketing approval.\nWe do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. We believe that our manufacturers have sufficient capacity to meet our current demand and, in the event that they fail to meet our demand, adequate alternative sources for such materials exist. However, there is a risk that if supplies are interrupted or result in poor yield or quality, it would materially harm our business. We will continue to evaluate product demand requirements and qualify alternate sources for momelotinib, and our other product candidates on an as-needed basis.\nManufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations are required to comply with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations, which are regulatory requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.\nGovernment Regulation\nFDA Approval Process\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, consent decrees, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil or criminal penalties, and criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.\nPharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n\u2022\ncompletion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with FDA\u2019s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;\n\u2022\nsubmission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;\n\u2022\napproval by an independent IRB ethics committee, either centralized or with respect to each clinical site, before each clinical trial may be initiated;\n\u2022\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;\n\u2022\nsubmission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;\n\u2022\ndetermination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for substantive review;\n\u2022\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;\n\u2022\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug\u2019s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and\n\u2022\nFDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.\nPrior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices (GLPs). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.\nA 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to eligible human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.\nThe FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) for approval. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove research. IRB review serves an important role in the protection of the rights and welfare of human\nresearch subjects. Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which may review data and endpoints at designated check points, make recommendations and/or halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.\nHuman clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\n\u2022\nPhase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.\n\u2022\nPhase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\u2022\nPhase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.\nPost-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nWhile the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.\nFurther, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, the FDA has issued guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including certain reporting requirements, and additional guidance on the good manufacturing practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection and other topics. We may be required to make further adjustments to our clinical trials or business operations based on current or future guidance and regulatory requirements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAssuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development nonclinical and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.\nThe FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency\u2019s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.\nThe FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.\nThe FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee-typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts-for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in a Complete Response Letter and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\nAfter FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter to the FDA satisfaction, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.\nIf regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug, and typically require substantial documentation and communication with the FDA.\nOnce approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product\u2019s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA\u2019s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.\nChanges to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.\nPediatric Information\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted; however, beginning in 2020, PREA will apply to NDAs for orphan-designated drugs if the drug is molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity-patent or non-patent-for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA\u2019s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.\nExpedited Development and Review Programs\nThe FDA has a Fast Track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. With regard to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.\nAny product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.\nIn addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Accelerated approval or Fast Track programs do not reduce the amount of clinical data necessary to establish the drug is both safe and effective or the standards for approval.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as \u201cbreakthrough therapies\u201d that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug.\nFast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. We previously announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation to momelotinib for the treatment of patients with intermediate/high-risk myelofibrosis who have previously received a JAK inhibitor. Even if a product qualifies for Fast Track designation or any of these other programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may continue to explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.\nDisclosure of Clinical Trial Information\nSponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.\nPost-Approval Requirements\nAny products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling changes, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.\nThe FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters, or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nclinical holds on post-approval or Phase IV clinical studies, if applicable;\n\u2022\nrefusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n\u2022\nconsent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nmandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products. A company can only promote the indications that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. In many cases, physicians view such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer\u2019s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product\u2019s FDA-approved labelling.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act\nOrange Book Listing\nIn seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant\u2019s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA\u2019s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as \u201cgeneric equivalents\u201d to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.\nThe ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product\u2019s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the\napplicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.\nThe ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.\nMarketing Exclusivity and Patent Term Extension\nMarket exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission and approval of certain marketing applications for products containing the same active ingredient. Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which FDA cannot approval an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.\nAfter NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent term extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug\u2019s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue testing and review with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from NDA approval. For patents that might expire during the review phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. Up to five years of patent term extension is potentially available for a single US issued patent directed to the momelotinib composition of matter upon NDA approval. We have acquired patent rights including two issued U.S. utility patents and one pending reissue application comprising claims directed to a polymorph and salt form of momelotinib. These patents will expire in 2035, absent any extension. If five years of patent term extension is applied to one of these patents, the patent exclusivity for momelotinib in the U.S. would extend to either 2040 or the maximum allowable 14-year limit from NDA approval, whichever is sooner.\nDuring the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (505(b)(2) NDA), submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.\nThe FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.\nPediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.\nOther Healthcare Laws\nIn the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products that we are developing are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with applicable health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, Stark law, and implementing regulations, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Other laws and regulations that may apply to prescription drug manufacturers include the Sunshine Act, prescription drug price reporting requirements, and various state transparency and reporting laws. All business activities of prescription drug manufacturers are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (PPACA) amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and any referral source on the other, including prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests, and service fees, unless expressly exempted or protected by a safe harbor. Further, the statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where one purpose of the remuneration was to obtain remuneration in exchange for referral or to induce further referrals for an item or service. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria of an applicable safe harbor for protection from liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by PPACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that the government does not need to prove that a person had the intent to specifically violate the statute in order to find a violation. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not expressly provide for certain safe harbors or impose different requirements for safe harbor protection under applicable state laws.\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted or cause to be submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare billing numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug\u2019s label), and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, provincial, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nIn addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including jurisdictions in which we conduct our clinical trials. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain \u201ccovered entities\u201d (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included expansion of HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security standards directly applicable to \u201cbusiness associates\u201d-independent contractors, service providers or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.\nThe Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires applicable manufacturers and certain distributors of prescription drugs, among other products, that are available for coverage by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third-party as directed by that entity, to covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; and (ii) physician ownership (including immediate family ownership) and investment interests in the entity. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting and transparency requirements will extend to include payments and transfers of value made during the previous year to certain non-physician covered recipients, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. There are also an increasing number of state and local \u201csunshine\u201d or transparency and reporting laws that require applicable manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. The U.S. federal government discloses the reported information on a publicly available website. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. These federal, state, and local laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.\nBecause of the breadth of these health care laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and corporate integrity agreement, which impose certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country or if we contract with vendors or independent contractors outside of the U.S., we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-approval requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-corruption/anti-bribery laws, anti-kickback laws, healthcare fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. While we are not aware of any current issues, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under applicable healthcare laws, or the impact of such actions on our business. However, the costs of defending such actions or claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nCoverage and Reimbursement\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of pharmaceutical products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Third-party payers may attempt to control costs by limiting coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, and by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.\nThe cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payer\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Some third-party payers also require pre-approval or prior authorization of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who prescribe such therapies or patients who use such prescription drugs. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably.\nThe marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nIn international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers\u2019 reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.\nHealthcare Reform\nIn the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.\nEnacted in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, or PPACA, is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, PPACA revises the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. For example, in November 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. In December 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. PPACA, as well as other legislation and regulations, may continue to place downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. These new laws may result in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nThere have been judicial and Congressional challenges and amendments to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future, including the potential repeal of all or part of PPACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nThere have been legislative and judicial efforts to repeal, replace, or change some or all of the ACA, including measures taken during the Trump administration. The Tax Reform Act, among other things, included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision that held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. It is uncertain how the United States Supreme Court will rule on this case or how healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA and our business. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans and the medical device excise tax, and effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, also amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, effective January 1, 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.\nFurther, there have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increased patient access to lower cost generic and biosimilar drugs. In particular, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. The FDA also released a final rule in September 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, in November 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The CMS also issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. In December 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. It is unclear to what extent these new regulations will be implemented and to what extent these or any future legislation or regulation by the Biden administration will have on our business, including our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability. We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved.\nOur business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals\nare government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently the SEC and the Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nForeign Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing, among other things, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drugs, and reimbursement requirements. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing.\nIn the European Union, Member States require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure or national procedure. An additional route (mutual recognition procedure) is based on the recognition of granted marketing authorizations by one or more EU countries. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of medicines, including human medicines containing new active substances to treat cancer.\nWe would be subject to the centralized authorization procedure, which provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (who, together with the European Union Member States) are members of the European Economic Area (EEA). Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. By law, a company can only start to market a medicine once it has received a marketing authorization.\nThe UK is no longer a member of the EU, but EU law remains applicable in Northern Ireland. There are a number of new marketing authorization routes available in the UK, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) or Northern Ireland, in addition to the national procedure. As with the EU position, a company can only start to market a medicine in the UK once it has received a marketing authorization.\nEuropean Regulation of Clinical Trials and Grant of Marketing Authorization\nPharmaceutical products in the European Union are subject to regulation under comprehensive legislation enacted by the European Commission in the European Medicinal Products Directive (Directive 2001/83/EC), as amended. Centrally authorized products are also regulated by Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004. This legislation is binding on all Member States together with ancillary legislation governing research. In the UK, the main legislative texts relating to human medicines is the Medicines Act 1968 and the Human Medicines Regulation 2012.\nClinical Trial Authorization\nClinical trials in the European Union are regulated under European Council Directive 2001/20/EC (Clinical Trials Directive) on the implementation of GCP in the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products for human use. The Clinical Trials Directive requires the sponsor of an investigational medicinal product to obtain a CTA, much like an IND in the United States, from the national competent authority of a European Union Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. The application for CTA must satisfy detailed requirements for the protection of trial subjects including requirements relating to consent and specific rules for minors and adults unable to consent by reason of incapacity. The CTA application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the Council Directive and corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance, including the European Commission Communication 2010/C 82/01. A clinical trial may only be commenced after an Ethics Committee has given its approval.\nA sponsor of a clinical trial must also follow certain procedures, including obtaining a unique EudraCT number by entering specified relevant information in the EudraCT Community Clinical Trial System. In addition, Member States require that the manufacture and/or importation of investigational medicinal products be authorized. Sponsors of investigational medicinal products must ensure compliance with, among other things, GCP and good manufacturing practice (GMP) as well as requirements pertaining to safety reporting.\nIn April 2014, Regulation EU No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted to replace the Clinical Trials Directive. The Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify the current rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance. For instance, there will be a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, a European Union portal and database. The implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation depends on confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) through an independent audit, which commenced in September 2020. The system is currently planned to go live in December 2021. The new clinical trial portal and database will be maintained by the EMA in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Union Member States. The objectives of the new Regulation include consistent rules for conducting trials throughout the European Union, consistent data standards and adverse events listing, and consistent information on the authorization status. Additionally, information on the conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the European Union will be made publicly available.\nThe main legislation that applies to clinical trials in the UK is the UK Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, which transposes the Clinical Trials Directive into domestic law. Consequently, the requirements and obligations that relate to the conduct of clinical trials in the UK currently remain largely aligned with the EU position. A CTA will be required to conduct a clinical trial in the UK, together with Ethics Committee approval. However, the sponsor of a clinical trial in the UK must be established in the UK or a country on an approved list (currently limited to the EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) or appoint a legal representative who is established on one of the aforementioned countries. Clinical trials should also be registered on an established international register such as ISRCTN registry or ClinicalTrials.gov. The UK also requires the manufacture and/or importation of investigational medicinal products to be authorised. There is no mutual recognition agreement between the UK and EU on GMP, so medicines manufactured in the UK would be subject to GMP release in the EU.\nProcedural Routes for Marketing Authorization in the European Union and UK\nThe European Union system for authorization of medicinal products for human use offers several routes: the centralized procedure, the decentralized procedure, and the mutual recognition procedure, as well as domestic national routes. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union Member States as well as the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain categories of investigational products, including human products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer, AIDS, diabetes and neurodegenerative illness; orphan medicinal products; and medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes. Applications for marketing authorization for such medicines must be submitted to the EMA, in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is generally responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product.\nThe decentralized and mutual recognition procedures are applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products and are both based on the principle of recognition of a marketing authorization by one or more Member States. The decentralized procedure is available for applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union Member States where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union Member State before. In this procedure, an application for marketing authorization is submitted simultaneously in several Member States, one of them being chosen as the \u201cReference Member State.\u201d At the end of the procedure, national marketing authorizations are granted in the Reference and in the concerned Member States. The mutual recognition procedure is compulsory when a medicinal product has already received a marketing authorization in one Member State and is to be marketed in a Member State other than that in which it was first authorized. Any national marketing authorization granted by a European Union Member State's national authority can be used to support an application for its mutual recognition by other Member States. Marketing authorization applications can also be submitted directly to the Member State's national competent authority under the national route (if the centralized route is not compulsory). There are now multiple routes to obtain a marketing authorization in the UK, Great Britain or Northern Ireland, which are broadly categorized as either (1) national routes (i.e. the innovative licensing and access procedure (ILAP), the national procedure, rolling review, EC Decision Procedure (ECDP), the MR/DC reliance procedure and unfettered access from Northern Ireland); or (2) international routes (i.e. Access Consortium to market a medicine in the UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore and/or Switzerland; or the Project Orbis program for cancer treatments). The application procedure will depend on the relevant procedure chosen.\nAll granted centrally authorized marketing authorizations automatically became Great Britain (GB) marketing authorizations on 1 January 2021. Though there are several ways to obtain a marketing authorization for GB (and Northern Ireland) discussed above, the EDRCP is available for marketing authorizations approved under the centralized procedure. Under this procedure the UK's regulator, the MHRA, can rely on the decision of the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization under centralized procedure for a period of two years from 1 January 2021 when determining an application for a GB marketing authorization. Applicants submit a letter of intent to submit an EDRCP to the MHRA at least 4 weeks before the submission of the application for the EDRCP marketing authorization application. The marketing authorization application is submitted after receipt of the positive opinion from the CHMP.\nStandard for Approval of a Marketing Authorization in the European Union and UK\nThe objective of the EMA is the comprehensive evaluation of benefit/risk profile of a new medicinal product going through the centralized procedure. This evaluation involves showing that the product has significant efficacy and safety, together with a satisfactory plan for risk management post-marketing. The CHMP is the EMA\u2019s expert committee responsible for human medicinal products. The CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial review of centrally authorized marketing authorization applications and for assessing modifications or extensions (variations) to an existing marketing authorization. It also considers the recommendations of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee on the safety of medicines on the market and when necessary, recommends to the European Commission changes to a medicine\u2019s marketing authorization, or its suspension or withdrawal from the market. The marketing authorization application is similar to the NDA in the United States. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document (CTD), which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and non-clinical and clinical trial information. The main scientific principle used by the CHMP in the evaluation of medicinal products is the benefit/risk ratio based on quality, efficacy, safety, and risk management considerations. The CHMP assesses whether the data it reviews comply with the ICH-harmonized Good Practices published for GCP, GMP and good laboratory practice (GLP). The CHMP also considers whether studies concluding efficacy and safety of products have sufficient statistical power.\nMarketing authorizations for the UK are submitted to the MHRA. As the Medicinal Products Directive is transposed into domestic law, the standards of clinical efficacy, safety, chemical control and manufacture as at 31 December 2020 (the end of the transition period for the UK\u2019s exit from the EU) are retained. As Northern Ireland continues to apply EU law, medicines regulation for Great Britain is likely to be closely aligned with the EU for some time.\nOther Regulatory Issues\nAn exemption to the rule requiring marketing authorization permits Member States of the European Union (and the UK) to make a product available for compassionate use to patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered life threatening, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product. The medicinal product concerned must be undergoing clinical trials or the subject of application for marketing authorization.\nQuality of the medicinal products in question is governed by the GMP Directives. These lay down the legal framework for GMP for both marketed medicinal products and investigational products in clinical trials. The Directive obliges manufacturers to comply with GMP for an effective pharmaceutical quality assurance, quality control, systems for recording and reviewing complaints and a system for prompt recall of products in the distribution network. With regards to post-marketing safety of newly authorized products, the EMA monitors and supervises the safety of medicines that have been authorized in the EU to ensure their benefits outweigh their risks. Volume 4 of EudraLex published by the European Commission provides GMP guidelines used to interpret the principles of GMP laid down in the GMP Directives..\nThe pharmacovigilance legislation imposes a duty on Member States to collect information on the risks of products with regards to patients\u2019 or public health. That information must refer to adverse events arising from the use of the medicinal product within the terms of the marketing authorization as well as use outside the authorized indication and use associated with occupational exposure.\nThere is a similar obligation on the marketing authorization holder (MAH) to operate a robust pharmacovigilance system equivalent to that of the relevant Member State. The MAH must evaluate all safety and effectiveness information scientifically, consider the options for risk minimization and take appropriate measures as necessary. As part of the pharmacovigilance system, the MAH must have permanently and continuously an appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance, maintain a pharmacovigilance master file, operate a risk management system for each medicinal product, monitor the outcome of risk minimization measures contained in the risk management program and continually update the risk management system and monitor the pharmacovigilance system to determine whether there are new risks or changes to the risk-benefit profile of the product(s).\nTwo recent developments have been introduced which further expand the European regulatory framework: the Falsified Medicines Directive and the Pharmacovigilance Directive. The Falsified Medicines Directive obliges manufacturers of medicinal products to audit their suppliers of active substances to ensure compliance with GMP. It also introduces a new obligation on product manufacturers to inform the competent authority (e.g., ANSM) and the marketing authorization holder if they become aware that these products may be falsified, whether they are being distributed through the legitimate supply chain or by illegal means. The Pharmacovigilance Directive obliges marketing authorization holders to monitor the safety of authorized products and detect any change in their risk-benefit profile. A new pan-European clinical trial data information database has been created that will be complementary to the database established for pharmacovigilance (Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with respect to centrally authorized medicinal products). In addition, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 outlines the practical implications for marketing authorization holders, national competent authorities, and the EMA. Also, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 on post-authorization efficacy studies specifies the situations in which such studies may be required. Post-authorization efficacy studies may be required where concerns relating to some aspects of efficacy of the medicinal product are identified and can be resolved only after the medicinal product has been marketed, or where the understanding of the disease, the clinical methodology or the use of the medicinal product under real-life conditions indicate that previous efficacy evaluations might have to be revised significantly. Brexit will disrupt the operation of pre- and post-authorization clinical trial infrastructure. The rules around GMP and pharmacovigilance in the UK currently remain similar to the EU requirements. However, the Falsified Medicines Directive will not apply in Great Britain though it is likely that the UK will implement a procedure to minimise the risk of falsified medicines.\nIn addition, in May 2016, the EU formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which applies to all EU member states from May 25, 2018 and replaced the European Union Data Protection Directive. The GDPR has imposed many new or additional requirements including, but not limited to, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the nature and scope of notifications provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and using third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. Failure to comply with the GDPR could subject us to regulatory sanctions, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution and/or civil fines or penalties. Additionally, GDPR creates a direct cause of action by individual data subjects. The GDPR is a complex law and the regulatory guidance is still evolving, including with respect to how the GDPR should be applied in the context of clinical trials or other transactions from that we may gain access to personal data. Beginning in 2021, the UK will be a \u201cthird country\u201d under the GDPR. These changes in the law will increase our costs of compliance and result in greater legal risks. Other countries maintain different privacy laws that we are subject to.\nApproval Outside the United States/European Union\nFor marketing outside the United States and the European Union, we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. Whether or not FDA or European Commission approval has been obtained for a product, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States or the European Union, as the case may be, must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries. Approval in one country does not assure that a product will be approved in another country. In certain countries, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar to those in the United States and the European Union, where approval decisions by regulators are based on the regulators\u2019 review of the results of clinical trials performed for specific indications. Other countries may have a less comprehensive review process in terms of data requirements and may rely on prior marketing approval from a foreign regulatory authority in other countries such as the United States or the European Union. In many countries outside of the United States, approvals for pricing, coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans, are also required.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 69 active employees, of which 14 had M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and 46 were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\nOur human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in May 2003 as Phenome Systems, Inc. and changed our name to ProNAi Therapeutics, Inc. in April 2004. Shortly thereafter, we merged with SenseGene Therapeutics Inc., a Michigan corporation, with ProNAi Therapeutics, Inc. being the surviving corporation. We changed our name to Sierra Oncology, Inc. in January 2017. Our principal executive offices are located at 1820 Gateway Drive, Suite 110, San Mateo, California 94404, and our telephone number is (650) 376-8679. Our website address is www.sierraoncology.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, and you should not consider information on our website to be part of this Annual Report.\nAvailable Information\nWe file Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our filings with the SEC are available free of charge on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on our website under the \u201cInvestors\u201d tab as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.\nItem 1A.",
    "section_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe below summary of risk factors provides an overview of many of the risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. As a result, the below summary risks do not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the summary risks together with the more detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section under the heading \"Risk Factors,\" as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks, beyond those summarized below or discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted or as we may conduct them in the future or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate. Consistent with the foregoing, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including risks associated with the following:\n\u2022\nWe have incurred net losses in every year since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nOur business is highly dependent on the success of momelotinib. If we are unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize momelotinib, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\u2022\nIf further preclinical development or clinical trials of momelotinib, or any other future product candidates that we may develop or acquire fail to demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of current or future product candidates.\n\u2022\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022\nWe will need to acquire additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of momelotinib and any future product candidates.\n\u2022\nThe manufacture of momelotinib and the comparator, danazol, requires outsourced, custom manufacturing and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to formulation, process development or scaling up of our manufacturing capabilities. If our third-party manufacturers or suppliers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of momelotinib for preclinical studies, clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, or danazol for the MOMENTUM trial could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.\n\u2022\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturing partners or suppliers may cause our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development materials to become limited or interrupted or fail to be of satisfactory quantity or quality.\n\u2022\nWe face significant competition from other hematology and oncology companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to adequately prepare the market for the potential future commercialization of a product, we may not be able to generate product revenue once marketing authorization is obtained. We currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell momelotinib or any future product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval of momelotinib, and, as a result, we may be unable to commercialize momelotinib.\n\u2022\nOur internal information technology systems, or those used by our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\n\u2022\nIf we or any of our independent contractors, consultants, collaborators, manufacturers, vendors or service providers fail to comply with healthcare and data privacy laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could result in penalties and affect our ability to develop, market and sell momelotinib or any future product candidates and may harm our reputation.\n\u2022\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies or momelotinib, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred net losses in every year since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical stage hematology and oncology company with a limited operating history. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $80.9 million, $88.3 million and $53.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $846.6 million. Investment in hematology and oncology product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. For example, in June 2016, we decided to suspend the development of our former lead product candidate PNT2258 after an interim analysis of data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of PNT2258 indicated only modest efficacy. We have also decided to suspend the continued development of SRA141, which was licensed to Carna Biosciences in June 2020, to focus our resources on the development of momelotinib and potentially SRA737. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue the development of momelotinib, fund research and preclinical studies and clinical trials, seek to identify additional product candidates, in-license additional products or technologies, seek regulatory approval, prepare for potential commercialization which will require a significant investment in areas related to contract manufacturing and inventory buildup and continue to operate as a public company.\nEven if we succeed in commercializing momelotinib, or any future product candidates we may acquire or develop, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market these and other product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success of momelotinib. If we are unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize momelotinib, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur business and future success depends on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize momelotinib, a potent, selective and orally-bioavailable JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 inhibitor. Momelotinib has been investigated in two completed Phase 3 trials for the treatment of myelofibrosis, and we launched our MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial for momelotinib in the fourth quarter of 2019 after receiving regulatory feedback concerning the design of the trial.\nWhile momelotinib is a late-stage product candidate for which previous Phase 3 clinical trial data suggest the potential to provide promising safety and efficacy in patients who are JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve and in patients who have previously received a JAK inhibitor such as ruxolitinib, it will require additional clinical testing, including at least one additional adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial, before we can seek regulatory approval and begin commercialization, if it all. While the FDA has provided regulatory clarity concerning the design of MOMENTUM, our Phase 3 clinical trial for momelotinib, there is no guarantee that we will obtain regulatory approval and be able to begin commercialization. Before we can generate any revenue from sales of momelotinib, we must complete additional development activities, including the submission of marketing applications such as New Drug Applications (NDAs) or foreign equivalents, for regulatory review and approval in at least one jurisdiction, make substantial investments, obtain access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and engage in significant marketing and commercial access efforts.\nWe cannot commercialize momelotinib in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA. Similarly, we cannot commercialize momelotinib outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States, such as the EMA in Europe and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom. Applications for regulatory approval and regulatory approval of momelotinib could be delayed or be denied for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe population studied in the clinical trial may not be considered sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of momelotinib may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or may otherwise not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, marketing authorization application or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidate\u2019s response rate, duration of response or risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications applicable to the manufacture of momelotinib, the facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies may fail to maintain a compliance status acceptable to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u2022\nwe or any third-party service providers may be unable to demonstrate compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) and/or good clinical practices (GCPs) to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, which could result in delays in regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe regulations or policies of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval;\n\u2022\npolitical factors surrounding the approval process, such as government shutdowns, political instability or global pandemics such as the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19; or\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to fully enroll or otherwise complete our MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEven if momelotinib were to be approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified patient populations, age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib or any future product candidate in one or more jurisdictions, or if any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development, marketing or commercialization of momelotinib or any future product candidate. If competitive products developed by third parties show significant benefit in the indications in which we are developing momelotinib, any planned supportive or primary registration trials may be delayed, altered, terminated or not initiated and any future product candidates may never receive regulatory approval. Our clinical development programs for momelotinib or any future product candidates may also not receive regulatory approval if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance these product candidates through the clinical trial process. Furthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib or any future product candidates, we will still need to develop sales, marketing and commercialization infrastructure, or collaborate with a third party for the commercialization of such product candidates, establish commercially viable pricing and obtain approval for coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government payors. If we are unable to successfully commercialize momelotinib or any future product candidate, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nIf further preclinical development or clinical trials of momelotinib, or any other future product candidates that we may develop or acquire fail to demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of current or future product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities, including the FDA, for the sale of momelotinib or any future product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product candidates in humans.\nThe outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later preclinical testing and clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Many companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development, and there is a high failure rate for product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. For example, in June 2016, we announced that we decided to suspend the development of our former lead product candidate PNT2258 after an interim analysis of data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of PNT2258 indicated only modest efficacy. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the required efficacy and safety profile from momelotinib, or any future product candidate. A failure of one or more preclinical studies or clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.\nWe previously acquired from Gilead momelotinib, a potent, selective and orally-bioavailable JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 inhibitor. Momelotinib has been investigated in two completed Phase 3 trials for the treatment of myelofibrosis, SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2. Based on the results of the prespecified analyses, neither trial was considered sufficiently compelling to justify the submission of an application for regulatory approval. Although SIMPLIFY-1 met its primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior spleen volume reduction, it did not meet its key secondary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior reduction in total symptom score; and although SIMPLIFY-2 did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of superior reduction in spleen volume, it did meet its key secondary efficacy endpoint of superior reduction in total symptom score. In both SIMPLIFY studies, additional secondary endpoints related to transfusion independence rate, transfusion dependence rate, and rate of red blood cell transfusions all favored momelotinib over control and supported the potential for momelotinib to provide meaningful anemia benefits. Based on post hoc analyses of the data for these trials that we subsequently conducted, we believe the trials showed promising substantive spleen and constitutional symptom control. In addition, we believe momelotinib has the potential to provide a differentiated therapeutic profile encompassing anemia-related benefits. As such, we have determined that there is substantial clinical justification for further development of momelotinib. However, while we believe the safety and efficacy profile of momelotinib in patients with myelofibrosis appears promising based on the prior Phase 3 trial results, the MOMENTUM Phase 3 trial we recently commenced in those patients may not be successful. This could occur for a variety of reasons related to efficacy or safety outcomes observed in the trial or to issues related to study conduct or study feasibility, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nfailure to identify sufficient countries willing to import and sites equipped to handle the active comparator danazol, a controlled substance in some countries;\n\u2022\ndelays in initiation and execution of the study in certain countries due to momelotinib and/or controlled substance danazol manufacturing, labeling, shipping and distribution logistical challenges;\n\u2022\nfailure to enroll or retain sufficient numbers of subjects because of competing studies, complexity of study design and/or the potential for patients to be randomized to the danazol-comparator arm;\n\u2022\ndelays in initiation of trial sites due to implementation of privacy and data protection legislation;\n\u2022\ndelays in initiation of trial sites or enrollment of patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nissues with data retention due to lack of adherence to privacy and data protection legislation;\n\u2022\ndelays in study initiation due to the collection of the primary endpoint data via patient reported outcomes on an electronic device, which requires questionnaire licensing, language translation and programming to support the global study;\n\u2022\nfailure to collect sufficient primary endpoint data for the study given its source of patient reported outcomes, including due to patients not accurately or consistently reporting their primary endpoint data or the device itself experiencing technical issues that result in inadequate primary data collection;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate sufficiently improved efficacy over the comparator arm of danazol either because momelotinib\u2019s efficacy in the trial is less robust than expected or because danazol performs better than expected, given danazol\u2019s limited data availability, on the efficacy endpoints; the SIMPLIFY-1 Phase 3 trial, for example, conducted by Gilead in ruxolitinib-naive patients did not demonstrate non-inferiority to its comparator arm of ruxolitinib for the key secondary endpoint of total symptom score; and\n\u2022\nfailure to observe meaningful anemia benefits in our planned Phase 3 trial, which could reduce the potential future value of momelotinib as we believe an anemia benefit could potentially provide a competitive advantage over existing therapies.\nAdditionally, the results of MOMENTUM could be altered, or the trial results could be difficult to interpret, if there is inadvertent unblinding of the treatment assignment of subjects prior to the subject being evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint or if too many subjects drop out of the study or discontinue the randomized study treatment prior to the subject being evaluable for the primary endpoint. Although danazol, the comparator selected for use in this trial, is not approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis, it is recommended by myelofibrosis guidelines as a treatment option for myelofibrosis associated anemia. Danazol\u2019s ability to control myelofibrosis disease manifestations may not be sufficient, and thus subjects randomized to the danazol arm may experience symptomatic deterioration which may increase the risk of inadvertent unblinding, early study discontinuation and/or early discontinuation of randomized treatment. Similarly, momelotinib may also not sufficiently control myelofibrosis disease manifestations in all subjects randomized to the momelotinib arm, and thus subjects in either treatment arm may also be at risk for early discontinuation.\nMoreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and even if the trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit momelotinib for approval. Many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. To the extent that the results of our studies and trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of momelotinib may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of momelotinib.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical studies and clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize momelotinib, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nundesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of momelotinib, causing us or our investigators, regulators or IRBs to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs may not authorize us or our investigators to initiate a clinical trial, conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or amend a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ngovernment or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites and contract research organizations (CROs), or failure by such CROs or trials sites to carry out the clinical trial in accordance with the terms of our agreements with them;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results of preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndecision by us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\na higher number of patients being required for clinical trials, slower than expected enrollment, greater than expected competition for patients or higher than expected drop out rates;\n\u2022\nclinical sites electing to terminate their participation in one of our clinical trials, which would likely have a detrimental effect on subject enrollment;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties with respect to our clinical trials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as delays in clinical site initiations and the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff, as well as delays or difficulties in the distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis;\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of patients or medical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nsuspension or termination of clinical trials for various reasons, including unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold for safety reasons or following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or site by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ngreater than expected cost of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninsufficient supply or quality of momelotinib or other materials, necessary to conduct clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain sufficient quantities of the comparator drug danazol, in view of its current global shortage to complete the trial as planned;\n\u2022\nFDA rejecting or disagreeing with our statistical plan;\n\u2022\nFDA disagreeing with the interpretation of our clinical data;\n\u2022\ndelays or additional costs as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union and resulting need to decouple the United Kingdom\u2019s regulatory system from that of the European Union; and\n\u2022\nrevision of legal or regulatory requirements for approving momelotinib.\nIf we are required to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or other testing of momelotinib beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete preclinical studies and clinical trials of momelotinib or other testing, or if the results of these studies, trials or tests do not reflect an acceptable safety or efficacy profile, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed or unable to submit additional CTAs or equivalents in one or more countries;\n\u2022\nnot have the permission of the FDA or other health authorities to commence clinical trials, or may have a clinical hold placed on one or more of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain marketing approval in some countries and not in others;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nProduct development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical studies or clinical trials will continue as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical studies and clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize momelotinib, any of which may harm our business and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, or similar public health crises, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the execution of our clinical trials and the use and sufficiency of our existing cash.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact.\nFor instance, our MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial for momelotinib has been and may continue to be affected by the pandemic. We launched MOMENTUM in the fourth quarter of 2019 and site initiation, participant recruitment and enrollment, participant dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis have been and may be delayed due to changes in hospital or university policies, federal, state or local regulations, prioritization of hospital resources toward pandemic efforts, or other reasons related to the pandemic. Additionally, some participants and clinical investigators may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols. For example, quarantines or other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) may impede participant movement, affect sponsor access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services, and we may be unable to conduct our clinical trial. We have adopted mitigation strategies, but if the global effort to control the spread of COVID-19 and treat COVID-19 patients continues on the current trajectory for an extended period of time, we risk a delay in activating sites and enrolling subjects as previously projected. Any such delays to our planned MOMENTUM timeline could also impact the use and sufficiency of our existing cash reserves, and we may be required to raise additional capital earlier than we had previously planned. We may be unable to raise additional capital if and when needed, which may result in further delays or suspension of our development plans. Challenging and uncertain economic conditions can make capital raising costly and dilutive.\nWe currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture raw materials, momelotinib and danazol (the comparator in the MOMENTUM trial), components, parts, and consumables, perform quality testing and distribute drug product. If either we or any third-party in the supply chain for materials used in the production of momelotinib or danazol, are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to source drug substance and drug product for our clinical trials.\nFurther, infections and deaths related to COVID-19 are disrupting certain healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems globally. Such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay review by, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies. As a result of the FDA\u2019s updated industry guidance for conducting clinical trials issued on March 18, 2020, we may experience delays in or temporary suspension of the enrollment of patients in our ongoing clinical trials. Based on these and new regulatory guidance, we may be required to make certain adjustments to our clinical trials, which could delay the submission of our NDA and regulatory approval and increase our costs. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any elongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trial or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially adversely affect the development and study of momelotinib. COVID-19 may also impact the resources and the availability of FDA to provide feedback and regulatory review or to conduct pre-approval inspections on a timely basis, which will delay our regulatory approval and increase our costs.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have closed our office with our employees continuing their work outside of our office. In the event of a shelter-in-place order or other mandated local travel restrictions, third parties conducting clinical or manufacturing activities may not be able to access laboratory or manufacturing space, and our core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, may have a material adverse effect on our business. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets and the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the global effort to control COVID-19 infections could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material adverse impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The Phase 3 MOMENTUM trial may be especially difficult to enroll because the trial is blinded and because the comparator arm does not contain a JAK inhibitor. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe number and size of clinical trials for other product candidates in the same therapeutic area that are currently in clinical development, and our ability to compete with such trials for patients and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocols;\n\u2022\nthe size of the specific patient populations such as those whose tumors harbor the applicable genetic mutations, if required or other defined subsets of a larger patient population;\n\u2022\nthe risk that disease progression will result in death or clinical deterioration before the patient can enroll in clinical trials or before sufficient data has been collected such that the patient contributes no meaningful information for the clinical trial in which the patient is enrolled;\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trials, including the inclusion of a placebo or comparator arm in a trial;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u2022\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion; and\n\u2022\ndelays and difficulties in enrollment or patient retention in the trial due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur clinical trials compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as momelotinib. This competition reduces the number and types of patients and qualified clinical investigators available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors or clinical trial sites may not allow us to conduct our clinical trial at such site if competing trials are already being conducted there. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. We may also encounter difficulties finding a clinical trial site at which to conduct our trials. Moreover, because momelotinib is experimental, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation and other approved therapies, rather than enroll patients in any one of our clinical trials. Global pandemics, such as COVID-19, have negatively affected site initiation, as well as recruitment and retention, at sites in regions or cities whose health care system have become overwhelmed due to the pandemic. For example, as a result of COVID-19, several of our clinical trial sites have paused enrollment or are not prioritizing clinical trial activities or allowing enrollment, and of those sites still conducting clinical trial activities, the availability for patients to visit sites and have screening conducted may be limited. We may also experience delays or pauses in the delivery of required site activity equipment.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these clinical trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of momelotinib or any future product candidates we may develop.\nWe will need to acquire additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of momelotinib and any future product candidates.\nWe expect to spend substantial capital to advance momelotinib or any future product candidates, in preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approvals for such product candidates, establish a commercial sales force to market and manufacture products, if any, that are approved for commercial sale. We also incur significant compliance and administrative costs as a result of operating as a public company.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our MOMENTUM Phase 3 trial and our other planned preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of product candidate discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our current and future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of momelotinib and any other future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of medical affairs and pre-commercialization activities, including regulatory and reimbursement analysis and market research;\n\u2022\nthe costs of future commercialization activities, including drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for momelotinib or any future product candidates for which we receive marketing approval, to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of any collaborator;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies, or to which we out-license our own products and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in business, products or technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we are able to enter into strategic partnerships and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties for the commercialization of momelotinib in certain global regions;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe success of any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of milestone and royalty payments;\n\u2022\nthe amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of momelotinib or any future product candidates, should any such product candidates receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; and\n\u2022\nthe compliance and administrative costs associated with being a public company.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve drug sales. In addition, momelotinib, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of momelotinib, if approved, which we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no committed source of additional capital, other than our outstanding warrants, and it may be difficult to raise the amount of capital needed to support planned development of momelotinib. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of momelotinib or other research and development initiatives. In particular, we do not have sufficient funds on hand to adequately prepare for future momelotinib commercialization, if approved. We could also be required to seek collaborators for momelotinib, at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to such product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves. We also may be unable to acquire additional promising product candidates.\nWe have acquired momelotinib from a third party that had already conducted or was in the process of conducting clinical trials. Our acquisition of momelotinib has resulted in us being required to take over responsibility for conducting ongoing momelotinib trials. We may discover that development efforts of the third parties, including but not limited to historical studies and trials conducted by third parties, did not comply with all applicable rules and regulations. Further development and commercialization of momelotinib will require significant financial and operational resources from us.\nPrior to our acquisition of momelotinib, third parties had been responsible for all development activities including, drug process, preclinical and clinical development activities, submission of CTAs and INDs, development of the trial protocols, establishment and management of clinical and safety databases, submission of a pediatric investigation plan (PIP), and other activities. Although we believe the historical development activities were conducted in accordance with applicable rules and regulations in material respects, we cannot assure you that we will not discover inaccuracies or noncompliance in prior development activities that have an adverse effect on the future development of momelotinib. For example, a regulatory authority may choose to inspect an investigational site and/or vendor such as a CRO for a momelotinib study that was previously conducted by Gilead such as the SIMPLIFY-1 or SIMPLIFY-2 studies. Findings from such inspections could have an impact on the review of any future marketing applications by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn connection with our acquisition of momelotinib, we have assumed the responsibility for ongoing clinical studies with momelotinib, including related expenses and manufacturing and regulatory activities, which were previously managed and funded by Gilead. This includes responsibility for the ongoing extended access study, which provides extended access of momelotinib to certain patients previously enrolled in Gilead-sponsored studies, who are currently receiving treatment with momelotinib and have not experienced progression of disease. Further, extended access programs provide supportive safety information for regulatory review. Any adverse events or reactions experienced by subjects in the extended access program may be attributed to momelotinib and may limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval with labeling that we consider desirable, or at all.\nFrom time to time we may amend the clinical protocols for momelotinib to include additional objectives that could yield important scientific information critical to our overall development strategy. The protocol amendment process requires review and approval by several review bodies, including regulatory agencies and scientific, regulatory and ethics boards. These protocol amendments may not be accepted by the review bodies in the form submitted, or at all, which may delay our planned enhancements to the clinical development program and/or limit or change the type of information we may gather from those studies.\nWhile regulatory feedback was obtained concerning the design of our Phase 3 clinical trial for momelotinib from both the United States and European Union regulatory authorities, additional regulatory, scientific, ethics committee, and possibly other reviews will be required during the activation process for the MOMENTUM Phase 3 trial before the protocol is active at any particular site. It is possible that these reviews could require changes to the design of the study. If the FDA, EMA, MHRA, an ethics committee or scientific review board, or another regulatory authority objects to or otherwise does not accept or approve any future protocols or protocol amendments or requires us to further modify trial protocols, our related planned clinical development program may be delayed or suspended and/or we may not be able to gather information we think would be useful to advance development of momelotinib, and our development program may be adversely affected.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or momelotinib.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. In November 2019 we conducted a public equity offering where we raised net proceeds of approximately $97.7 million in a substantially dilutive transaction to our pre-existing investors. In August 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to $20.0 million of our common stock from time to time in ATM offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 732,752 shares under the ATM program for net proceeds of $8.9 million, net of commissions and offering expenses. In January 2021, we sold an additional 450,000 shares under the ATM program for proceeds of $7.1 million, net of commissions. In addition, in February 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to $30.0 million of our common stock from time to time in ATM offerings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be further diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or momelotinib or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate, such as momelotinib, and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may later prove to be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. In addition, we may intentionally halt or terminate programs in order to conserve capital and focus on our remaining program or programs, which may increase our reliance on those programs to be successful.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus our research and development efforts on our product candidate, momelotinib. As a result, we may advertently or inadvertently forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates, including SRA737, that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. In addition, if we halt or terminate programs in order to conserve capital and focus on our remaining program or programs, it may increase our reliance on the success of such programs and raise our exposure to the risk of failure among any of our programs.\nWhile we have currently deprioritized development of SRA737, we are exploring options for future development of this product candidate, if any. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain development support or the funding necessary to advance SRA737 on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain such support or funding, we may need to permanently cease development of SRA737.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the anticipated accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are and will be based on numerous assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, our stock price may decline.\nThe manufacture of momelotinib and the comparator, danazol requires outsourced, custom manufacturing and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to formulation, process development or scaling up of our manufacturing capabilities. If our third-party manufacturers or suppliers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of momelotinib for preclinical studies, clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, or danazol for the MOMENTUM trial could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.\nAs product candidates are developed, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause momelotinib to perform differently and affect the results of planned preclinical studies or future clinical trials.\nCurrently, momelotinib is manufactured using an optimized drug substance process by third-party manufacturers. If either we or any third-party in the supply chain for materials used in the production of momelotinib are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting the ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture momelotinib for our clinical trials.\nSupply chain logistics are complex for the MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial of momelotinib, as it requires the administration of both an active drug (momelotinib) and a comparator (danazol) and there are risks associated with this process throughout the supply chain, from manufacturing, labeling, to distribution, dispensing, and administration. Although we have secured sufficient quantities of drug substance and drug product to supply our current momelotinib program, starting with the MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial of momelotinib, we will need to obtain additional supplies from third-party manufacturers that we have engaged, or expect to engage. We have also secured sufficient quantities of danazol drug product to supply the comparator for the initial subjects who will enroll in the study. However, additional sourcing of danazol will be necessary in the future in order to complete the MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial. Currently, there is a global shortage of danazol. We will need to obtain additional supplies from third-party manufacturers that we have engaged or expect to engage. We are also working with regulatory agencies to extend the shelf life of our current supply of danazol to ensure that our current supply will not expire before we complete our Phase 3 clinical trial. Simultaneously, we are also working with our current supplier to manufacture more danazol. While we are taking multiple measures to ensure sufficient supply of danazol required to complete the Phase 3 trial, we could nevertheless face challenges that potentially impact the ability to execute and complete the MOMENTUM trial as we anticipate. Any shortage in the clinical supplies could delay our clinical trial plan.\nFurthermore, if third-party manufacturers of danazol, or any third-party in the supply chain, are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, we may be unable to secure the supply required for our MOMENTUM study. Any potential limitation in supply of either momelotinib or danazol during the conduct of the MOMENTUM trial could be exacerbated due to the use of several regional depots and the number of sites that are participating in the study. Drug is shipped to sites as they enter a patient into screening. If the rate of screening exceeds expectations, there could be logistic challenges in refilling the supply at the depot. Although additional drug\nproduct could be shipped from another regional depot, logistic challenges could delay this as well. If the supply in a regional depot becomes depleted, screening in that region might need to be temporarily suspended until the supply is replenished. Although we are working to develop commercially viable manufacturing processes, doing so is a difficult and uncertain task, and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or commercialization, including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale up or formulation, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency and timely availability of reagents or raw materials.\nAny of these challenges could delay completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials, require bridging studies or trials, or the repetition of one or more studies or trials, increase development costs, delay approval of momelotinib, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturing partners or suppliers may cause our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development materials to become limited or interrupted or fail to be of satisfactory quantity or quality.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture and supply of preclinical study and clinical trial materials in relation to momelotinib, including materials for any combination trials that we may undertake, and any future potential product candidates that we may develop for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if momelotinib receives marketing approval. We have engaged, or expect to engage, third-party manufacturers to obtain materials and consumables necessary for the manufacture of momelotinib.\nWe may be unable to establish further agreements with third-party manufacturers and suppliers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers entails additional risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for sufficient quantity and quality;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing or supply agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nfailure to manufacture or supply the product according to our specifications;\n\u2022\nfailure to manufacture or supply the product according to our schedule or at all;\n\u2022\nthe possible mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or comparator not being properly identified;\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions; and\n\u2022\nthe reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, quality assurance and safety reporting.\nWhile we require our third-party manufacturers and suppliers to comply with cGMPs in the manufacture of clinical trial materials and commercial supply, should we obtain approval of momelotinib, these third-party manufacturers and suppliers may cease to continue to comply with cGMPs-which are FDA requirements for ensuring product quality control-or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our contract manufacturers and suppliers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, although we are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers or suppliers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products and product candidates, and any other materials that may be used in our preclinical or clinical studies or trials, are manufactured or supplied in accordance with cGMPs. Therefore, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, quality control and quality assurance. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in momelotinib not being approved or sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of momelotinib or approved products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our medicines and harm our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our third-party manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes, or unstable political environments, or medical pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, many of our raw materials for manufacture of momelotinib are produced in Asia which could impact our ability to manufacture and supply material for clinical and commercial supply. If our contract manufacturers were to encounter any manufacturing difficulties or delays due to these factors, our ability to provide momelotinib to patients in clinical trials, or to provide product for treatment of patients once approved, would be jeopardized.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials required for the production of our product candidates, and we expect to some extent continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our dependence on these third-party suppliers and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules and non-exclusivity. As a small company, our negotiation leverage is limited, and we are likely to get lower priority than our competitors who are larger than we are. We do not have long-term supply agreements, and we purchase our required supplies on a development manufacturing services agreement or purchase order basis. We cannot be certain that our suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require to satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements. Any supply interruption in limited or sole sourced raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our product candidates until a new source of supply, if any, could be identified and qualified. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms. Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, including limiting supplies necessary for clinical trials and regulatory approvals, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers or suppliers, any interruption or poor yield or quality of manufactured or supplied materials, or any interruption or delay caused by a third party being subject to governmental regulations or moratoriums could result in additional costs, not having sufficient quantities or sufficient quality and may delay, prevent or impair our development, commercialization or marketing efforts. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. If any one of our current contract manufacturers or suppliers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace that manufacturer or supplier. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers or suppliers who could manufacture or supply momelotinib or the materials for trials relating to momelotinib, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nIf our third-party manufacturers or suppliers use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by our third-party manufacturers or suppliers. Our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers\u2019 and our suppliers\u2019 procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nThus, our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture or supply of momelotinib or related medicines and materials may adversely affect our development timeline, our future profit margins or our ability to commercialize momelotinib or any future product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nOur product candidates including momelotinib may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences.\nIt is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with any assessment of the safety profile of momelotinib. Undesirable side effects caused by momelotinib could cause us, IRBs, our CROs, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or discontinue development and could result in a clinical hold on any clinical trial, or the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications. This, in turn, could prevent us from commercializing momelotinib and generating revenues from their sale. In addition, if any of our products cause serious or unexpected side effects or are associated with other safety risks after receiving marketing approval, a number of potential significant negative consequences could result, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of this product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to recall the product, change the way it is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022\nthe product may be rendered less competitive and sales may decrease;\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer generally both among clinicians and patients;\n\u2022\nwe may be exposed to potential lawsuits and associated legal expenses, including costs of resolving claims;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require certain labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications or limitations on the indications for use, or impose restrictions on distribution in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) in connection with approval, if any;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials; or\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change or stop other ongoing clinical studies that may negatively impact the development of the agent for other indications.\nIf preliminary data demonstrate that momelotinib has an unfavorable safety profile and is unlikely to receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized, we may voluntarily suspend or terminate future development of momelotinib.\nAny one or a combination of these events could prevent us from obtaining approval and achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing momelotinib, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of the product.\nWe do not have our own laboratory facilities. We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize momelotinib.\nWe do not have our own laboratory facilities. We depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities, medical institutions, CROs and strategic partners to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We expect to have to negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs and trial sites, which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. We will rely heavily on these third parties over the course of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with GCPs and GLPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for clinical and non-clinical research intended to support a submission or application to FDA or the comparable foreign authority. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable requirements, the data generated in our studies and trials\nmay be deemed unreliable and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional studies or trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our studies or trials comply with the GCP or GLP requirements. In addition, our studies and trials must be conducted with drug product produced under cGMPs. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat studies or trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties conducting our preclinical studies and clinical trials will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our studies and trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize momelotinib. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for momelotinib would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive, or the trials are not well-designed.\nRegulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs, or other applicable foreign regulatory authority guidelines. Clinical trials are subject to oversight by the FDA, foreign regulatory authorities and IRBs at the study sites where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced in accordance with applicable cGMPs. Clinical trial data may be rejected by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA, foreign regulatory authorities, or us for various reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols or to obtain or maintain clinical trial data in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the trial designs necessary to demonstrate efficacy;\n\u2022\nfatalities or other adverse events (AEs) arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may or may not be related to clinical trial treatments;\n\u2022\nthe product candidates may not appear to be more effective than current therapies;\n\u2022\nthe quality or stability of the product candidates may fall below acceptable standards; or\n\u2022\nfailure to adequately demonstrate study conduct oversight, ensure data integrity, and that clinical study sites complied with the principles of GCPs.\nAlthough we have never been asked by a regulatory agency, IRB or data safety monitoring board to temporarily or permanently discontinue a clinical trial, if we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of momelotinib or any future product candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. For example, in June 2016, we decided to suspend the development of our former lead product candidate PNT2258 after an interim analysis of data from a Phase 2 clinical trial on PNT2258 indicated only modest efficacy. Furthermore, any of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing momelotinib and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our collaboration partners.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market momelotinib, the market may not be receptive to our product.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib, it may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and/or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of momelotinib and competitive product;\n\u2022\nsafety and efficacy of our product;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\npotential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nstrength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nprice of our products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nsequencing of available products.\nIf momelotinib is approved for commercial sale and fails to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue or achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may be subject to requests for access to momelotinib. Demand for compassionate use of our unapproved therapies could strain our resources, delay our drug development activities, negatively impact our regulatory approval or commercial activities, and result in losses.\nWe are developing momelotinib to treat a life-threatening illness for which there are currently limited therapeutic options. Other companies in our field have been the target of campaigns requesting access to unapproved drugs. If we experience similar request for access campaigns, we may experience significant disruption to our business which could result in losses. We are a small company with limited resources, and any unanticipated trials or access programs resulting from requests for access could deplete our drug supply, increase our capital expenditures, reduce the availability of potentially eligible clinical trial participants, and otherwise divert our resources from our primary goals.\nIn addition, legislation referred to as \"Right to Try\" laws have been introduced at the local and national levels, which are intended to give patients access to unapproved therapies. New and emerging legislation regarding expanded access to unapproved drugs for life-threatening illnesses could negatively impact our business in the future. Either activism or legislation related to requests for access may require us to initiate an unanticipated expanded access program or to make momelotinib more widely available sooner than anticipated.\nPatients who receive access to unapproved drugs through compassionate use or expanded access programs have life-threatening illnesses and generally have exhausted all other available therapies. The risk for serious adverse events, including those which may be unrelated to momelotinib, in this patient population is high and could have a negative impact on the safety profile of momelotinib, which could cause significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize momelotinib and could materially harm our business. In addition, in order to perform the controlled clinical trials required for regulatory approval and successful commercialization of momelotinib, we may receive adverse publicity or experience other disruptions if we do not provide compassionate use access or expanded access programs in response to requests for access from patients in the US or elsewhere in the world. Should we agree to provide compassionate use access or decide to initiate an expanded access program, we could experience adverse publicity or other disruptions related to current or potential participants in such programs. Similarly, we could experience adverse publicity or other disruptions if we were to restructure or pause any compassionate use and/or expanded access program after initiating such a program or after the provision of our product through compassionate access to an individual patient or patients.\nWe do not have our own laboratory facilities or the ability to discover product candidates. We rely on licensing, acquisition and other forms of strategic relationship to grow our pipeline. Our efforts to acquire additional product candidates and grow our pipeline may be unsuccessful.\nWe do not have our own laboratory facilities or the ability to discover product candidates. We rely on licensing, acquisition and other forms of strategic relationship to grow our pipeline. We may acquire, or enter into strategic relationships to identify, license and develop, one or more additional product candidates to grow our pipeline. In addition, we may desire to renegotiate our currently existing licensing or asset purchase agreements for any of our product candidates. The identification, evaluation, development and potential acquisition or licensing of additional product candidates is expensive and time-consuming, and our efforts may not lead to the acquisition or licensing of any additional product candidates, that can be successfully developed and commercialized. Competition for viable product candidates is intense, and the acquisition or licensing of product candidates may be more expensive than we are able to afford or may require us to seek additional financing. If our efforts do not lead to the acquisition or successful identification, development and licensing of suitable product candidates, we may be unable to grow our pipeline. In addition, if our efforts to grow our pipeline require us to pursue additional dilutive capital or debt financing strategies, we may experience harm to our financial position and stability.\nEven if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development. For example, they may be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our approach, we will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price.\nWe face significant competition from other hematology and oncology companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe hematology and oncology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We may face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies that are available for the indication or indications for which they are approved and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nTo our knowledge, there are currently two approved myelofibrosis drugs that specifically rely on JAK inhibition, ruxolitinib, marketed by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi\u00ae in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi in the rest of the world and fedratinib, marketed by Celgene Corporation as Inrebic\u00ae in the United States. Fedratinib was also recently approved in Europe. In addition, there is one additional JAK inhibitor competitor in clinical development, at a similar state of development or more advanced than us. CTI Biopharma Corporation is developing pacritinib, for a subset of myelofibrosis patients with platelet counts less than 50,000/uL and commenced its rolling NDA submission in October 2020. However, to our knowledge, there are no drugs that target JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 on the market, nor in development. Other competitors developing myelofibrosis therapeutics include Acceleron, Constellation Pharma, AbbVie, Kartos and Incyte. Celgene and Acceleron are developing luspatercept in a Phase 3 clinical trial for myelofibrosis. Constellation Pharma is developing pelabresib (CPI-0610), a BET inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical trial in combination with ruxolitinib. AbbVie announced two Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with ruxolitinib for JAKi na\u00efve and previously JAKi treated patients. Kartos announced clinical trial plans for KRT-232, a MDM2 inhibitor for JAKi relapsed or refractory MF patients. Incyte launched Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate parsaclisib, in combination with ruxolitinib. In addition, there are several Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials being conducted in myelofibrosis by various companies, including a Phase 2 study of a deuterated form of momelotinib being run by Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals in China. Several additional companies are advancing assets in the early stages of development potentially for the myelofibrosis market. If momelotinib is approved, it will compete with existing therapies for the indication or indications for which it is approved. While we believe that momelotinib may have the ability to provide an anemia benefit in addition to treating the other manifestations of myelofibrosis, which we believe is unique within the JAK inhibitor class of agents, the market for momelotinib is competitive, and physicians and other prescribers may not recommend or prescribe momelotinib over other competing products.\nMany of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the hematology and oncology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our momelotinib program. Development efforts and clinical results of other companies may be unsuccessful or terminated, which could result in a negative perception of momelotinib, decreases in our stock price and adverse regulatory impacts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our ongoing development programs and our business.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if any competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors who may place restrictions on patient access to our drugs in seeking to encourage the use of generic or cheaper drugs. If we fail to complete effectively, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nWe are dependent on our key personnel, and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive oncology industry depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We have in the past and may in the future continue to experience changes in our executive management team resulting from the departure of executives or subsequent hiring of new executives, which may be disruptive to our business. Any changes in business strategies can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy and advance development, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. The impact of hiring new executives may not be immediately realized. We are substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing management, scientific and medical personnel, including Dr. Stephen Dilly, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Barbara Klencke, our Chief Development Officer, and Dr. Mark Kowalski, our Chief Medical Officer, because of their familiarity with momelotinib and our development efforts. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees and other scientific and medical advisors, including due to illness resulting from COVID-19, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could result in delays in product development and harm our business.\nOur operations are conducted in regions where significant competition exists for key personnel and employees. Many other oncology companies and academic and research institutions are located in these regions. Competition for skilled personnel in these markets is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have employment agreements with our key employees, these employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nShould momelotinib receive marketing approval in the United States, Canada, or elsewhere in the world, we would need to hire a substantial number of specialized personnel, including field-based personnel, unless we were to collaborate with a third party to commercialize momelotinib. If we are responsible for commercializing momelotinib, we would need to increase our administrative headcount to support such expanded development and commercialization operations with respect to momelotinib. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future is subject to intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses and our current financial position. The loss of the services of any of our senior management could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of momelotinib or have other adverse effects on our business for an indefinite term. In particular, if we lose any members of our current senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely fashion, if at all, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our expected growth and in expanding our operations successfully.\nPrior to acquiring momelotinib, our most advanced product candidate was in Phase 1/2 development. Advancing momelotinib through Phase 3 development, will require us to develop or expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, medical affairs, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. We must also successfully integrate the employees and operations related to the development of momelotinib. Maintaining additional relationships and managing our future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management. We must be able to manage our development efforts effectively, manage our clinical trials effectively, hire, train and integrate additional management, development, medical affairs, administrative and sales and marketing personnel, improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, and expand our facilities, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this growth effectively. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, failure of which could prevent us from successfully developing and potentially commercializing momelotinib.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or other collaborations in the future. We may be unable to form or enter into such alliances or arrangements, and we may not realize the expected benefits of any such transaction.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances or licensing arrangements, or create joint ventures or collaborations with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to momelotinib and any future product candidates that we may acquire or develop, or that may provide for other economic value. For example, in June 2020, we licensed SRA141 back to Carna Biosciences, the original licensor. We may be entitled to certain profit share on royalty and non-royalty income and royalties on product sales. If Carna Biosciences or its collaborators fail to successfully develop and commercialize SRA141, we will receive limited to no value from this transaction. This or any future strategic transactions and relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, disrupt our management and business, forego potential future economic value or result in the loss of strategic value. These transactions and relationships also may result in a delay in the development of momelotinib or any future product candidates if we become dependent upon the other party and such other party does not prioritize the development of such product candidates relative to its other development activities.\nIn addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for momelotinib because it may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort or third parties may not view momelotinib as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that would justify such transaction.\nPast and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or product candidates from third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing momelotinib program. For example, in August 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Gilead whereby we acquired worldwide rights to the pharmaceutical product momelotinib, an investigational orally-bioavailable JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 inhibitor together with all related intellectual property rights and certain other related assets. Even if the assets we acquire have promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such assets if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new product candidates resulting from an acquisition, including momelotinib, which may delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the expected synergies or benefits from the asset to justify the transaction. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions, including our acquisition of momelotinib, include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\nintegration of research and development efforts;\n\u2022\nhiring or training of key employees with knowledge regarding the acquired asset;\n\u2022\nchanges in relationships with strategic partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees, knowledge and processes related to the acquired asset into our organization;\n\u2022\nunanticipated write-offs or charges; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired asset.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm the business generally. There is also a risk that future acquisitions will result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or incremental operating expenses, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results.\nIf we are unable to adequately prepare the market for the potential future commercialization of a product, we may not be able to generate product revenue once marketing authorization is obtained. We currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell momelotinib or any future product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe have not yet begun to prepare for potential future commercialization, and currently have limited commercialization expertise, including no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and no experience in marketing products. Advancing momelotinib through Phase 3 development and closer to potential approval will require us to begin commercialization preparation activities and incur related expenses before we obtain final trial results and know whether MOMENTUM will support regulatory approval. These activities will include, among other things, the development of an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with other companies to recruit, hire, train and retain qualified marketing and sales personnel. If we are unable to adequately prepare the market for the potential future commercialization of a product, we may not be able to generate product revenue once marketing authorization is obtained.\nAdditionally, if we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized momelotinib or any future product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of momelotinib.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop in-house commercialization expertise, including sales and distribution capabilities, or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any product in the United States or overseas.\nWe depend on our information technology and infrastructure.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of information technology systems, including mobile technologies, to manage our operations, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for communications among our personnel, contractors, consultants and vendors. System failures or outages, including any potential disruptions due to significantly increased global demand on certain cloud based systems during the COVID-19 situation, could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business or delay our financial reporting. Such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we depend on third parties to operate and support our information technology systems. These third parties vary from multi-disciplined to boutique providers, and they may have access to our computer networks, mobile networks, and our confidential information. Many of these third parties subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to other third parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including those functions that are performed by third parties who are involved with or have access to our systems, are very large and complex. Failure by any of these third-party providers to adequately deliver the contracted services, or maintain confidentiality and adequate security controls, could have an adverse effect on our business, which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Although we take measures designed to prevent security breaches and cyberattacks, these efforts may not completely eliminate the risk of such incidents and we cannot guarantee security incidents will not impact us in the future. We may need to continuously increase cost and resources to protect security threats and their consequences. If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached, such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised.\nOur internal information technology systems, or those used by our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nDespite our efforts to implement effective administrative, technical, and physical security measures and controls, our internal information technology systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants may become vulnerable to damage from security breaches and/or unauthorized access. The prevalent use of mobile devices also increases the risk of data security incidents resulting from lost or stolen devices or compromised security controls. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personal information, health information, financial information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such sensitive information. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, a security breach. When we have experienced security breaches in the past, we took immediate action to prevent any additional unauthorized access, put further security controls in place and worked with outside counsel for any necessary reporting requirements. Any material system failure or security breach could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of data from completed or future preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in significant delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on other third parties for the manufacture of momelotinib and to conduct studies and trials, and similar events relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including personal and sensitive information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of momelotinib could be significantly delayed.\nUnstable or unfavorable global market and economic conditions may have adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. Global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions in the past several years, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. We cannot assure you that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy and stock price may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or large-scale unpredictable or unstable market conditions, including a prolonged government shutdown or as a result of a global pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nIf the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive difficult economic times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by such individuals could include intentional failures to comply with FDA or international regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data timely, completely and accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by third parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials.\nWe have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of momelotinib outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nEven if approved, our product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in clinical trials compared to alternative treatments\u037e\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of the product candidate as well as competitive products\u037e\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved\u037e\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of our product candidates, such as boxed warnings or contraindications in labeling, or a REMS, if any, which may not be required of alternative treatments and competitor products\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments\u037e\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments\u037e\n\u2022\npricing and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government authorities\u037e\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration\u037e\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies\u037e\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts\u037e\n\u2022\nunfavorable publicity relating to our products or product candidates or similar approved products or product candidates in development by third parties\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe approval of other new therapies for the same indications.\nIf any of our product candidates is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate or derive sufficient revenue from that product candidate and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate before and may lack the necessary expertise, personnel and resources to successfully commercialize any products on our own or together with suitable collaborators.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate. We may license certain rights with respect to our product candidates to collaborators, and, if so, we will rely on the assistance and guidance of those collaborators. For product candidates for which we retain commercialization rights and marketing approval, we will have to develop our own sales, marketing and supply organization or outsource these activities to a third party.\nFactors that may affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, on our own include recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel, developing adequate educational and marketing programs to increase public acceptance of our approved product candidates, ensuring regulatory compliance of our company, employees and third parties under applicable healthcare laws, and other unforeseen costs associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. Developing a sales and marketing organization will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay the launch of our product candidates upon approval. We may not be able to build an effective sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to build our own distribution and marketing capabilities or to find suitable partners for the commercialization of our product candidates, we may not generate revenues from them or be able to reach or sustain profitability.\nIf the market opportunity for any product candidate that we develop is smaller than we believe, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nWe intend to initially focus our product candidate development on treatments for various oncology indications, including myelofibrosis. The addressable patient populations that may benefit from treatment with our product candidates, if approved, are based on our estimates. These estimates, which have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations and market research, may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. Any regulatory approval of our product candidates would be limited to the therapeutic indications examined in our clinical trials and as determined by the FDA, which would not permit us to market our products for any other therapeutic indications not expressly approved by the FDA. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may not ultimately be amenable to treatment with our product candidates. Even if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, such approval could be conditioned upon label restrictions that materially limit the addressable patient population. Our market opportunity may also be limited by future competitor treatments that enter the market. If any of our estimates prove to be inaccurate, the market opportunity for any product candidate that we or our strategic partners develop could be significantly diminished and have an adverse material impact on our business.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of momelotinib.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the testing of momelotinib and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if momelotinib causes or is perceived to cause injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of momelotinib. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for momelotinib;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize momelotinib; and\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price.\nWe currently hold liability insurance coverage, but that coverage may not be adequate to cover any and all liabilities that we may incur. We would need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin the commercialization of momelotinib, if ever. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to eventually seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries, such as the lack of pathways for accelerated drug approval, may result in foreign regulatory approvals taking longer and being more costly than obtaining approval in the United States;\n\u2022\nforeign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, implementation or results of our clinical trials or our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\napproval policies or regulations of foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval;\n\u2022\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to produce our product candidates and conduct clinical trials in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with legal requirements applicable to privacy, data protection, information security and other matters;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes and government payors in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be significantly limited, or entirely restricted.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had gross U.S. federal net tax operating loss carryforwards of 54.8 million that are eligible for an indefinite carryforward, and gross state operating loss carryforwards of $52.4 million expiring in years ranging from 2022 to 2040. As of December 31, 2020, we also had U.S. net tax credit carryforwards of $4.6 million which begin to expire in 2039 and net tax credit carryforwards in a foreign jurisdiction of $0.5 million which begin to expire in 2038.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.\nWe have experienced ownership changes in the past, including in 2017 and 2019, and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in certain U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. federal, state and local, as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. If we are unsuccessful in such a challenge, the relevant tax authorities may assess additional taxes, which could result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expense related to momelotinib or future development programs;\n\u2022\nresults of preclinical studies and clinical trials, or the addition or termination of preclinical studies, clinical trials or funding support;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the release of results from any preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of milestone and royalty payments;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive landscape or market opportunity for momelotinib;\n\u2022\nour execution of any new collaboration, licensing or similar arrangement, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under such existing or future arrangements or the termination or modification of any such existing or future arrangements;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nany securities or other litigation in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures,\n\u2022\nstrategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022\nthe receipt of regulatory approval for momelotinib, and market acceptance and demand for momelotinib;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting momelotinib or those of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market and economic conditions, including global pandemics such as COVID-19.\nIf our quarterly operating results or expected results from development of momelotinib fall outside the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval of momelotinib, and, as a result, we may be unable to commercialize momelotinib. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nMomelotinib is, and any future product candidates that we may develop will be, subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, import, export, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing, distribution, import and export of drugs. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be successfully completed before a new drug can be marketed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time-consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them.\nAs a company, we have very limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, and, as a company, we have no experience in obtaining approval of any product candidates. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the initiation of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. We may encounter delays or rejections during any stage of the regulatory review and approval process based upon the failure of clinical or laboratory data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure of the product candidates to meet, the FDA\u2019s or foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 requirements for safety, efficacy and quality.\nThe standards that the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities use when regulating us are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Because the product candidates we are developing or may develop may represent a new class of drug, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines in relation to these drugs. The lack of policies, practices or guidelines may hinder or slow review by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities of any regulatory filings that we may submit. Moreover, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may respond to these submissions by defining requirements we may not have anticipated. Such responses could lead to significant delays in the development of momelotinib or any future product candidates.\nAny analysis we perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA or foreign regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulatory authority, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nIn addition, the FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities may delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials, including our statistical plan;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate the integrity of the clinical trial data to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate the proper conduct of the clinical trial at all clinical trial sites, by our vendors, and by the Sponsor to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties coming to agreement with the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities on a pediatric investigation or study plan or may encounter difficulties meeting the terms of the plan, once agreed;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may find deficiencies in our manufacturing processes or facilities;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may lack resources or are delayed in conduct pre-approval inspections due to reasons related to COVID-19; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 approval policies or regulations may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nEven if we comply with all of the regulatory requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, we may not obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib, we will have no commercialized products and correspondingly no revenue.\nIn addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of the diseases for which we may seek approval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we may need to demonstrate through clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat these diseases, if any, are not only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been increased public and political pressure on the FDA with respect to the approval process for new drugs, and the FDA\u2019s standards, especially regarding drug safety, appear to have become more stringent.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular product candidate for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which we may market the product or the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a REMS plan as part of or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved product, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nIf we or any collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our products by the market. These enforcement actions include, among others:\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory inspection findings;\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls or public notification or medical product safety alerts to healthcare professionals;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing our products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or prohibitions against, importation or exportation of our products;\n\u2022\nsuspension of review or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022\nexclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nexclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our products;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of product approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures;\n\u2022\ninjunctions; and\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal penalties and fines.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States and vice versa.\nIn Europe, the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation depends on confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) through an independent audit, which commenced in September 2020. The system is currently planned to go live in December 2021. The new clinical trial portal and database will be maintained by the EMA in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Union Member States. The objectives of the new regulation include consistent rules for conducting trials throughout the European Union, consistent data standards and adverse events listing, and consistent information on the authorization status. Information on the conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the European Union will be made publicly available.\nIn addition, a new pan-European clinical trial data information database has been created that will be complementary to the database established for pharmacovigilance (Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with respect to centrally authorized medicinal products). In addition, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 outlines the practical implications for marketing authorization holders, national competent authorities, and the EMA. Also, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 on post-authorization efficacy studies specifies the situations in which such studies may be required. Post-authorization efficacy studies may be required where concerns relating to some aspects of efficacy of the medicinal product are identified and can be resolved only after the medicinal product has been marketed, or where the understanding of the disease, the clinical methodology or the use of the medicinal product under real-life conditions indicate that previous efficacy evaluations might have to be revised significantly.\nBrexit is also expected to disrupt the operation of pre- and post-authorization clinical trial infrastructure. The rules around GMP and pharmacovigilance in the UK currently remain similar to the EU requirements. However, the Falsified Medicines Directive will not apply in Great Britain though it is likely that the UK will implement a procedure to minimise the risk of falsified medicines.\nUncertainty in the regulatory framework and future legislation can lead to disruption in the execution of international multi-center clinical trials, the monitoring of adverse events in through pharmacovigilance programs, the evaluation of the benefit-risk profiles of new medicinal products, and determination of marketing authorization across different jurisdictions. There could also be disruption to the supply and distribution as well as the import/export both of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished product. Such a disruption could create supply difficulties for ongoing clinical trials and may damage the integrity of the pharmacovigilance database for the safety of new products.\nThe cumulative effects of the disruption to the regulatory framework, uncertainty in future regulation, and changes to existing regulations may add considerably to the development lead time to marketing authorization and commercialization of products in the European Union and/or the United Kingdom and increase our costs. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and future regulation on our business or the results of our operations.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval of any product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for any product candidates we may develop will require surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate, and may require us to conduct post-approval clinical studies. The FDA may also require a REMS in order to approve momelotinib or any future product candidates, which could entail requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority approves momelotinib, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, AE reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for momelotinib will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.\nMoreover, if we obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib, we will only be permitted to market our products for the indication approved by FDA or foreign regulatory authority, and such approval may involve limitations on the indicated uses or promotional claims we may make for our products, or otherwise not permit labeling that sufficiently differentiates momelotinib from competitive products with comparable therapeutic profiles. For example, we will not be able to claim that our products have fewer side effects, or improve compliance or efficacy unless we can demonstrate those attributes to FDA or foreign regulatory authority in comparative clinical trials. Communications that occur prior to obtaining regulatory approval for momelotinib could also be considered promotional and thus may also be subject to certain FDA or foreign regulatory authority requirements.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with momelotinib, including adverse effects of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of momelotinib, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing delays and supply disruptions where regulatory inspections identify observations of noncompliance requiring remediation;\n\u2022\nrevisions to the labeling, including limitation on approved uses or the addition of additional warnings, contraindications or other safety information, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nimposition of a REMS, which may include distribution or use restrictions;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct additional post-market clinical trials to assess the safety of the product;\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters, or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nholds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of license approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of momelotinib; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions, the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\nThe FDA\u2019s and foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nMoreover, the FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about drug products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue and could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity.\nA Fast Track designation by the FDA, even if granted for momelotinib or any future product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that such product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nIf a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track designation for a particular indication. Marketing applications filed by sponsors of products in Fast Track development may qualify for priority review under the policies and procedures offered by the FDA, but the Fast Track designation does not assure any such qualification or ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. We previously announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation to momelotinib for the treatment of patients with intermediate/high-risk myelofibrosis who have previously received a JAK inhibitor. Receipt of Fast Track designation may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw any Fast Track designation at any time if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. We may seek Fast Track designation for any future product candidates, but there is no assurance that the FDA will grant this status to any future proposed product candidates.\nIf we or any of our independent contractors, consultants, collaborators, manufacturers, vendors or service providers fail to comply with healthcare and data privacy laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could result in penalties and affect our ability to develop, market and sell momelotinib or any future product candidates and may harm our reputation.\nWe are or may in the future be subject to federal, state, and foreign healthcare and data privacy laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, fraud and abuse, data protection and patients\u2019 rights. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for a healthcare item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, claims for payment by government funded programs such as Medicare or Medicaid that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to us by virtue of statements and representations made to customers or third parties;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which imposes requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable protected health information (PHI), and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of PHI;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members, which is published in a searchable form on an annual basis; effective January 1, 2022, we will also be required to report on transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives; and\n\u2022\nstate laws comparable to each of the above federal laws, such as, for example, anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and also apply to commercial insurers and other non-federal payors, requirements for mandatory corporate regulatory compliance programs, and laws relating to patient data privacy and security. Other state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIn the European Union (EU), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted in 2016 and took effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is intended to harmonize data protection requirements across the EU Member States by establishing new and expanded operational requirements for entities that process, or control personal data generated in the EU, including consent requirements for disclosing the way personal information will be used, information retention requirements, notification requirements in the event of a data breach, and other requirements. In addition, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. Recent developments have also created uncertainty regarding the rules around such data transfers.\nA breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease or change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of internal resources, and reputational harm. Beginning in 2021, the UK will be a \u201cthird country\u201d under the GDPR. We may, however, incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable EU Member States and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them. In particular, from January 2021, after the end of the Brexit transitional period, we could potentially be exposed to two parallel regimes, each with the power to impose fines up to the greater of either 4% of total global annual revenue, or \u20ac20 million (for the EU) or \u00a317.5 million (for the United Kingdom).\nOn July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU (ECJ) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a mechanism for managing personal data transfers between the EU and the U.S. and onward to other countries. While the ECJ upheld the adequacy of EU-specified standard contractual clauses (SCCs), a form of contract approved by the EU commission as an adequate data transfer mechanism, it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that their use must be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the surveillance laws and right of individuals in the U.S and other onward countries. The ECJ went on to state that, if the competent supervisory authority in an EU country believes that the SCCs cannot be complied with in the recipient country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means, such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer unless the data exporter has already done so itself. For example, German and Irish supervisory authorities have indicated that the SCCs alone provide inadequate protection for EU-U.S. data transfers.\nWe are currently certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield with respect to our transfer of certain personal data from the EU to the U.S. however, we have evaluated and are in the process of updating the mechanisms we currently use to transfer personal data from the EU and the United Kingdom to the U.S., and any additional mechanisms that may be required to maintain adequate safeguards for personal data transfer. As a result, we may be unsuccessful in maintaining appropriate compliance mechanisms for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EU or the United Kingdom and to the U.S. and may be at risk of experiencing reluctance or refusal of European or multi-national partners, clinical trial sites or other third parties with whom we do business and incurring potential regulatory penalties, which may have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nAs supervisory authorities continue to issue further guidance on personal data transfers, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, or regulatory investigations or fines, and if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn the United States, state and federal lawmakers and regulatory authorities have increased their attention on the collection and use of personal information. In the United States, non-sensitive personal information generally may be used under current rules and regulations, subject to certain restrictions, so long as the person does not affirmatively \u201copt-out\u201d of the collection or use of such data. If an \u201copt-in\u201d model or additional required \u201copt-outs\u201d, were to be adopted in the United States, less data would be available, and the cost of data would be higher. For example, California recently enacted the CCPA, which became operative on January 1, 2020 and became enforceable by California Attorney General on July 1, 2020, along with related regulations which came into force on August 14, 2020.\nThe CCPA gives California residents new rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is collected, used, and shared. Given that CCPA enforcement began on July 1, 2020, it remains unclear whether modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. Additionally, the CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state-level privacy legislation. Further, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The CPRA, which is expected to take effect on January 1, 2023 and to create obligations with respect to certain data relating to consumers as of January 1, 2022, significantly expands the CCPA, including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations, granting additional rights to consumers, such as correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights, and creates a new entity, the California Privacy Protection Agency, to implement and enforce the law. The CCPA and CPRA present many unresolved compliance complexities. The CCPA and CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. In addition to the CCPA, numerous other states\u2019 legislatures are considering similar laws that will require ongoing compliance efforts and investment.\nAdditionally, if our operations are found to be in violation of any such health care and data privacy laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, fees from regulators, fines, significant settlements or judgments resulting from the CCPA\u2019s private right of action, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely impact our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation by a private party or governmental agency could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, adversely impact our reputation, and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Any products we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Many countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. The pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted in most cases. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. Although we intend to monitor these regulations, our momelotinib program is currently in development and we will not be able to assess the impact of price regulations for a few years. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. In many jurisdictions, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products. If we are not currently capturing the scientific and clinical data that will be required for reimbursement approval, we may be required to conduct additional trials, which may delay or suspend reimbursement approval. Additionally, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of momelotinib to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nIn the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Even if we succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any products may be insufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Because our programs are still in clinical development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost effectiveness or the likely level or method of reimbursement. Increasingly, the third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans, who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for pharmaceutical products. If the level of reimbursement provided for any products we develop is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our return on investment could be adversely affected.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to patients with disabilities and seniors. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs, such as momelotinib, if approved. Medicare Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In addition, CMS has published a final rule to give states greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or ATRA, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Other legislative changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2021 includes allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. Additionally, the Trump administration previously released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. The FDA also released a final rule in September 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, in November 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturer. It is these and future regulations that the Biden administration may take will affect our business.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for momelotinib or additional pricing pressures.\nWe may face difficulties from changes to current regulations and future legislation. Healthcare legislative measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates or any future product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell a product for which we obtain marketing approval. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example:\n\u2022\nchanges to our manufacturing arrangements;\n\u2022\nadditions or modifications to product labeling;\n\u2022\nthe recall or discontinuation of our products; or\n\u2022\nadditional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.\nOur revenue prospects could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future, including revisions to the PPACA. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nthe demand for our product candidates, if we obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u2022\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital.\nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for biotechnology products. We cannot be sure to what extent these and future legislative and regulatory efforts, whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nDisruptions at the FDA, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, in recent years, including in 2018 and 2019, the U.S. government shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. Separately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020 the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products through April 2020. On March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities and provided guidance regarding the conduct of clinical trials. In May 2020, FDA announced that it will continue to postpone domestic and foreign routine surveillance inspections due to COVID-19. While the FDA indicated that it will consider alternative methods for inspections and could exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis to approve products based on a desk review, if a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns or delays could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for momelotinib or any future product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for momelotinib or any future product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nWe may also submit marketing applications in other countries. Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States have requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of momelotinib or any future product candidates will be harmed.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by ourselves and our third-party manufacturers. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States and abroad governing laboratory procedures and the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers\u2019 procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations. We can face serious consequences for violations.\nAmong other matters, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, which are collectively referred to as Trade Laws, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of trade laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase in time. We plan to engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could increase our tax burden and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, (i) a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, (ii) revisions to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards (iii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, and (iv) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a participation exemption system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base).\nIn addition, beginning in 2022, the tax legislation will require U.S. research and experimental expenditures to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year period. Any such expenditures attributable to research conducted outside the U.S. must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period. Further, the Tax Act, among other things, reduces the orphan drug credit from 50% to 25% of qualifying expenditures. When and if we become profitable, this amortization of research and experimental expenditures and reduction in orphan drug tax credits may result in an increased federal income tax burden, as it may cause us to pay federal income taxes earlier under the revised tax law than under the prior law and, despite being partially off-set by a reduction in the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, may increase our total federal tax liability.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies or momelotinib, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights, methods used to manufacture momelotinib and methods for treating patients using momelotinib, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nWe and our future licensors and licensees may not be able to apply for or prosecute patents on certain aspects of momelotinib or our technologies at a reasonable cost in a timely fashion or at all. It is also possible that we or our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using, and selling competing products. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods, and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued or granted patents, that any of our issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid or unenforceable or that any issued or granted patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover momelotinib or our technologies or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. Moreover, the patent position of oncology companies can be highly uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our current and future proprietary technology and momelotinib are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If third parties disclose or misappropriate our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely impact our position in the market.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. The standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in oncology patents. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. While we will endeavor to try to protect momelotinib with intellectual property rights such as patents, as appropriate, the process of obtaining patents is time-consuming, expensive and sometimes unpredictable.\nFurther, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed (or 20 years after the filing date of the first non-provisional US patent application to which it claims priority). Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for momelotinib, we may be open to competition from generic versions of momelotinib. Further, the extensive period of time between patent filing and regulatory approval for a product candidate limits the time during which we can market a product candidate under patent protection, which may particularly affect the profitability of momelotinib.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of momelotinib and our technologies, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how important to the maintenance of our competitive position. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us.\nDespite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect momelotinib.\nNumerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) enacted in 2011 involves significant changes in patent legislation. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application.\nFurther, the Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, some of which cases either narrow the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weaken the rights of patent owners in certain situations. These changes have led to increasing uncertainty with regard to the scope and value of our issued patents and to our ability to obtain patents in the future.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future.\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification derivation and opposition proceedings in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such initial grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether.\nWe or any future strategic partners may become subject to third-party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights.\nWe or any future strategic partners may be subject to third-party claims for infringement or misappropriation of patent or other proprietary rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products. If we, our licensors or any future strategic partners are found to infringe a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. In addition, we or any future strategic partners may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a third party, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to effectively market product candidates, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. Alternatively, we may need to redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition, we may find it necessary to pursue claims or initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nWe have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWe have limited intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to oncology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our purchase agreement with Gilead, we may be required to pay damages.\nIn connection with our acquisition of momelotinib from Gilead, we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of up to $190.0 million to Gilead upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as low double-digit to high-teens percent tiered combined royalties based upon net sales and additional tiered milestone payments upon reaching certain sales milestones. If we breach any of these obligations, we may be required to indemnify the Seller, subject to certain limitations set forth in the momelotinib purchase.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other oncology companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. For example, we experienced a significant decrease in our stock price after we announced the suspension of the development of our former lead product candidate PNT2258 and the DNAi platform in June 2016 and after we announced the preliminary clinical data from our two Phase 1/2 studies of SRA737 in June 2019. In addition, the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe success of existing or new competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and results of development activities related to our product candidates including momelotinib;\n\u2022\nour capital requirements, financings and the related dilution;\n\u2022\nthe commencement, enrollment or results of future clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our product candidates including momelotinib;\n\u2022\nany delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates including momelotinib and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such filings;\n\u2022\nany disputes with Gilead regarding our acquisition of momelotinib and assumption of the related clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire or in-license new product candidates to grow our pipeline;\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates including momelotinib, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u2022\nadverse developments concerning our manufacturers;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nour inability to establish collaborations if needed, or to out-license our product candidates including momelotinib or technologies on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nour failure to commercialize our product candidates including momelotinib;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates including momelotinib;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe size and growth of our initial target markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully treat additional types of cancers or at different stages;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry, or immunotherapy in particular, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\nthe low trading volume and limited public market for our common stock;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nactions instituted by activist shareholders or others;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions, including global pandemics such as COVID-19;\n\u2022\nfiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and oncology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Securities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. For example, we have previously vigorously defended purported securities class action lawsuits against us and certain of our executive officers. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nMarket volatility arising from the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to increased shareholder activism if we experience a market valuation that they believe are not reflective of their intrinsic value. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, or rights to acquire shares of our common stock could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock to finance our operations or fund acquisitions, or for other purposes. For example, in November 2019, we conducted a public equity offering where we raised net proceeds of approximately $97.7 million in a substantially dilutive transaction to our pre-existing investors. In August 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which it can issue and sell an aggregate of up to $20.0 million of our common stock from time to time in ATM offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 732,752 shares under the ATM program for net proceeds of $8.9 million, net of commissions and offering expenses. In January 2021, we sold an additional 450,000 shares under the ATM program for proceeds of $7.1 million, net of commissions. In addition, in February 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to $30.0 million of our common stock from time to time in ATM offerings. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, if any of our existing stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock, or if the market perceives that such issuances or sales may occur, then the trading price of our common stock, and, accordingly, the trading price of our common stock may significantly decrease. In addition, our issuance of additional shares of common stock, including upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.\nWe incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the stock exchange upon which our common stock is listed and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. However, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nPursuant to Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, while we remain a non-accelerated filer, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404.\nIn addition, since it has been more than five years since we completed our initial public offering, we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and may no longer take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. This increase in reporting requirements will further increase our compliance burden. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d however, we are still able to take advantage of certain exemptions available to both emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies.\nWe have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or personnel, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that there will not be additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that our independent registered public accounting firm or we will identify. If we identify such issues or if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d);\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. In April 2020, we amended and restated our restated bylaws to provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (a Federal Forum Provision). Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.\nSection 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, neither the exclusive forum provision nor the Federal Forum Provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court.\nOur stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal Forum Provision. These provisions may limit a stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of their choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.\nCertain of our 5% stockholders hold a majority of the voting power and may be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of January 31, 2021, our executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding voting shares. Further, four of our current directors are affiliates of certain 5% stockholders. Therefore, these holders may have the ability to influence us through their ownership position and through representation on our board of directors as they hold half of the board seats. These holders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these holders may be able to control the vote with respect to elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock.\nGeneral Risks\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nCyberattacks upon systems, across industries, are increasing in their frequency, persistence, and sophistication, and are being conducted by sophisticated, well-funded, and organized groups and individuals. These cyberattacks may occur on our systems or those of our third-party providers or partners. Additionally, certain threats are designed to remain dormant or undetectable until launched against a target and we may not be able to implement adequate preventative measures. Such cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service, and/or other means to threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Those engaging in attacks may implement social engineering techniques to induce our employees or contractors to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain improper access to data or systems. Further, security breaches and other security incidents may result from employee or contractor malfeasance, error or negligence or those of service providers on which we rely. A successful cyberattack could cause serious negative consequences for us, including, without limitation, the disruption of operations, the loss or misappropriation of confidential business information and trade secrets, unauthorized access to or other compromise of personal information or other sensitive information, and the disclosure of corporate strategic plans. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, a compromise of our data or information technology systems that results in one or more third parties obtaining access to confidential information about our company or sensitive information about individuals, such as employees or clinical trial participants. Although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems and continue to assess and, as necessitated, enhance our cybersecurity protection, we realize that cyberattacks are a threat, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business, legal or reputational harm to us, or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We also may be required to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents. Confidential information obtained by third parties in connection with past or future attacks could be used in ways that adversely affect our company or our stockholders. The majority of our workforce works remotely rather than in our offices, and we may be more susceptible to security breaches and incidents as a result. Further, we engage third-party service providers to store and otherwise process sensitive and personal information, including our CROs. Our CROs and other service providers face substantial risks of security breaches and incidents. Our service providers may be more susceptible to security breaches and other security incidents while social distancing measures restrict the ability of their employees to work at offices to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Depending on the nature of any information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our sensitive information, we may also have obligations to notify affected individuals and regulators about the incident, and we may be required or find it appropriate to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to credit monitoring services, pay significant fines to one or more regulators, or pay compensation in connection with a class-action settlement (including under the new private right of action under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA)). Laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity and notification and other obligations in connection with security breaches and incidents continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations and otherwise responding to any security breach or incident could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises, or is perceived to have compromised, sensitive data.\nWhile our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, subject to applicable deductibles, our insurance coverage might not be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we may not have insurance coverage. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. In particular, the potential effects on our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic may be significant and could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce and process momelotinib. Our ability to obtain supplies of momelotinib could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. Our corporate headquarters are located in San Mateo, California, which is near a major earthquake fault. Our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near any of our locations.\nWe face risks related to securities litigation that could result in significant legal expenses and settlement or damage awards.\nWe have in the past and may in the future become subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws or other related claims, which could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. Any future litigation may require significant attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in interpretation or application of generally accepted accounting principles may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe prepare our financial statements to conform to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and various other regulatory or accounting bodies. A change in interpretations of, or our application of, these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Additionally, as we are required to adopt new accounting standards, our methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the securities or industry analysts who publish research about us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable evaluations of our company or our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, our stock may lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nItem 1B.",

Our main focus is the development of momelotinib, an investigational agent for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Currently, momelotinib is in a global Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with myelofibrosis, called the MOMENTUM study, that if successful will be registration enabling. At its completion, approximately 1,000 myelofibrosis patients will have received momelotinib, and several of our clinical trial patients remain on treatment more than 10 years later.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, we acquired momelotinib from Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead), which had completed several late-stage trials of the drug candidate in patients with myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is characterized by progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia and currently approved JAK inhibitor therapies, ruxolitinib and fedratinib, can induce or further exacerbate this myelosuppression, limiting their use in first line treatment and resulting in a population of second line patients who are no longer able to benefit from such therapies. Momelotinib is a novel, orally-bioavailable JAK1 (Janus kinase 1), JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and ACVR1 (Activin A receptor type 1) inhibitor with a differentiated mechanism of action, enabling it to potentially address all three hallmarks of disease in myelofibrosis: anemia of inflammation, constitutional symptoms and enlarged spleen.\nIn December 2018, we reported new data for momelotinib collated from the two completed SIMPLIFY Phase 3 clinical trials and a translational biology study in transfusion dependent patients with myelofibrosis. Data from the latter study were also concurrently presented in a poster at the 60th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition in San Diego, California. We reported aggregated transfusion independence responses from more than 150 intermediate and high-risk transfusion dependent myelofibrosis patients demonstrating robust and consistent response rates within and across the clinical studies. More than 44% of these patients became transfusion free for at least 12 weeks and nearly 50% were transfusion independent for at least 8 weeks.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we announced that we had obtained regulatory clarity with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning the design of a Phase 3 clinical trial intended to support potential registration of momelotinib. We also announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation to momelotinib for the treatment of patients with intermediate/high-risk myelofibrosis who have previously received a JAK inhibitor.\nFollowing receipt of this clarity, we announced the design of the MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial in myelofibrosis, which we subsequently launched in the fourth quarter of 2019. MOMENTUM is a randomized double-blind trial designed to enroll 180 myelofibrosis patients who are symptomatic and anemic and have been treated previously with a JAK inhibitor. The Primary Endpoint of the trial is the Total Symptom Score (TSS) response rate of momelotinib compared to danazol at Week 24 (99% power; p-value < 0.05). Danazol has been selected as an appropriate treatment comparator given its use to ameliorate anemia in myelofibrosis patients, as recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines. Patients are being randomized 2:1 to receive either momelotinib or danazol. After 24 weeks of treatment, patients on danazol are being allowed to crossover to receive momelotinib.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported new analyses of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion data from SIMPLIFY-1, a double-blind Phase 3 trial of momelotinib head-to-head versus ruxolitinib in JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve patients, which were presented in a poster by Dr. Ruben Mesa, Director of the Mays Cancer Center, home to UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center, at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida. These analyses demonstrated that patients who received momelotinib had significantly decreased transfusion requirements compared to those treated with ruxolitinib, including an odds ratio of nearly 10 for receiving no transfusions during the 24-week study period. Transfusion dependency and moderate to severe anemia are critical negative prognostic factors for overall survival in myelofibrosis.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, at the 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Virtual Congress, we reported favorable Long-Term Safety and Dose Intensity data for momelotinib from more than 550 patients across the two previously conducted SIMPLIFY Phase 3 studies and their subsequent ongoing extended treatment periods. More than 90 SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2 patients continued to receive momelotinib for 3.5 years or longer. These data were presented in posters by Professor Claire Harrison, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom, and Dr. Vikas Gupta, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada. The key findings were:\n\u2022\nConsistent with prior data, and reflecting momelotinib's differentiated pharmacological profile, our new long-term safety analyses continue to show a rapid and sustained increase in hemoglobin levels during momelotinib therapy, in contrast to the significant decrease in hemoglobin for patients receiving ruxolitinib. Patients treated with momelotinib also experienced significantly higher mean platelet counts compared to those receiving ruxolitinib. Importantly, patients who switched from ruxolitinib to momelotinib also achieved a sustained improvement in hemoglobin in both studies, and platelets in SIMPLIFY-1. In addition to an absence of significant rates of high-grade hematological toxicities, long-term tolerability was favorable with no new safety signals or evidence of cumulative toxicity.\n\u2022\nMomelotinib's safety profile and durable benefits facilitated sustained dose intensity across the continuum of JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve and previously JAK inhibitor treated myelofibrosis patients. While the starting doses for ruxolitinib were often attenuated due to low platelets, further reductions in dose intensity were also commonly required for ruxolitinib. In contrast, momelotinib was initiated at full dose for all subjects enrolled to the SIMPLIFY studies and high dose intensity was maintained in the majority over extended durations. Patients who switched from ruxolitinib to momelotinib saw an immediate and sustained improvement in dose intensity.\n\u2022\nThe data from the two interrelated presentations suggest that the favorable effect on hemoglobin and platelets allows momelotinib to be initiated at full dose intensity and maintained for the majority of patients at full dose intensity over extended durations while retaining a favorable long-term safety profile. Notably, some patients continued to receive momelotinib 10 years after enrolling in the initial momelotinib Phase 2 trials while 90 Phase 3 SIMPLIFY patients who enrolled into those trials 4 to 6 years ago continued to receive momelotinib. We believe the dosing and safety profile may contribute to momelotinib\u2019s potential ability to provide sustained benefits over extended durations.\nMost recently, we released updated analyses from the previously completed Phase 3 SIMPLIFY studies of momelotinib at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2020, including overall survival data as well as efficacy data for momelotinib compared to ruxolitinib in patients with low platelet levels. The overall survival data received an oral presentation by Dr. Srdan Verstovsek of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, USA; efficacy data by platelet strata were presented in a poster by Dr. Jean-Jacques Kiladjian, Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France. Key findings were:\n\u2022\nRobust overall survival was observed in both JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve and previously ruxolitinib treated patients. Sustained transfusion independence was observed with extended momelotinib treatment, and the median duration of TI in the momelotinib arm has not been reached after more than three years of follow up. We believe these data, in combination with previously reported safety data, further highlight where momelotinib may be a viable treatment option for myelofibrosis patients including those who are not ideal candidates for currently approved therapies.\n\u2022\nThe retrospective analysis of the two Phase 3 SIMPLIFY studies demonstrate that the relative benefit-risk profile of momelotinib and ruxolitinib is influenced by baseline platelet count. In SIMPLIFY-1, momelotinib achieved substantially higher Transfusion Independence (TI) and splenic response rates and had a similar symptomatic response relative to ruxolitinib in patients whose baseline platelet count was <150 x 109L. For patients whose platelet count was 150 - 300 x 109/L, momelotinib achieved a higher TI response rate and generally similar splenic and symptom response rates. In patients with platelet counts >300 x 109/L, ruxolitinib achieved higher splenic and symptom response rates than momelotinib, and the TI rate remained higher with momelotinib. These updated analyses complement previous findings that demonstrate the ability to initiate and maintain near-maximal momelotinib dose intensity regardless of baseline platelet count, suggesting that this durable dosing contributes to its efficacy profile.\nDuring 2020, we continued to operationalize the MOMENTUM trial on a global basis, and we anticipate closing screening in the first half of 2021 and remain on track to complete enrollment in mid-2021. Top-line data are currently anticipated in the first half of 2022 and we anticipate filing for regulatory approval of momelotinib in the second half of 2022. Due to the recent global outbreak of COVID-19, our clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected, and we are likely to experience delays in anticipated timelines and milestones, which will be difficult to predict until we have more visibility on the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential institution of additional public health orders. We have experienced and may continue to experience some delays in planned site initiations and activations and may experience future delays in overall enrollment.\nWe believe that our current resources will be sufficient to execute on our development strategy for momelotinib into the second half of 2022, subject to the potential impact of COVID-19. We are also starting to explore non-dilutive options that could provide additional capital to support our North American commercialization strategy.\nOur portfolio also includes SRA737, a selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), an emerging target for the treatment of cancer which has a key role in the DNA Damage Response (DDR). In November 2020, we entered into an amendment to the License Agreement with CRT Pioneer Fund (CPF) to allow for the potential future clinical development of SRA737.\nWe wholly own momelotinib, subject to future milestone payments and royalties, and retain the global commercialization rights to SRA737.\nSince inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities, including the clinical development of momelotinib and SRA737 as well as SRA141 and PNT2258, our former product candidates, and to provide general and administrative support for our operations. We have never generated product revenue and have incurred significant net losses since inception. Our net losses were $80.9 million, $88.3 million and $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $846.6 million, of which approximately $428.0 million pertained to the revaluation and conversion of redeemable convertible preferred stock upon our initial public offering in July 2015, $37.2 million related to changes in fair value of our Series A and Series B warrant liabilities until their reclassification to equity in the first quarter of 2020, and $12.0 million pertained to a securities issuance obligation settled during the first quarter of 2020.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our clinical studies, employee or industry events, and effect on our suppliers and manufacturers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have become more prevalent in the locations where we, our CROs, suppliers or third-party business partners conduct business and as a result, we have begun to experience more pronounced disruptions in our operations. We may experience constrained supply of momelotinib or comparator drug required for our ongoing Phase 3 trial, or, with respect to our clinical trials, delays in enrollment, site initiation, participant dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis that could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. Specifically, we may experience impact from changes in how we and companies worldwide conduct business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to restrictions on travel and in-person meetings, prioritization of hospital resources toward pandemic effort, delays in review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, and disruptions in our supply chain for momelotinib. Any such delays to our planned MOMENTUM timeline could also\nimpact the use and sufficiency of our existing cash reserves, and we may be required to raise additional capital earlier than we had previously planned. We may be unable to raise additional capital if and when needed, which may result in further delays or suspension of our development plans. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition, results of operations or guidance is uncertain. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. See the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our common stock and convertible voting preferred stock and accompanying warrants through public offerings (including At-The-Market (ATM) equity offerings), and our convertible and redeemable convertible preferred stock in private financings and, to a lesser extent, through exercises of our preferred stock warrants in private financings. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $104.1 million.\nComponents of Statements of Operations\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue consists of upfront license fees recognized under a collaboration agreement with Carna Biosciences, Inc.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of the following:\n\u2022\nfees, milestone payments or other expenses incurred in connection with license and asset purchase agreements and their related amendments;\n\u2022\npersonnel-related costs, which include salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, recruitment fees and travel costs;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with research and preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory activities and manufacturing activities to support clinical activities;\n\u2022\nfees paid to external service providers that conduct certain research and development, clinical and manufacturing activities on our behalf; and\n\u2022\nfacility-related costs, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation and amortization expenses and other supplies.\nThe largest recurring component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including the development of momelotinib. We expect our research and development expenses will increase over the next few years as we advance momelotinib, potentially including combination studies as the field of myelofibrosis evolves, achieve regulatory milestones that trigger payments due under our Asset Purchase Agreement with Gilead, pursue regulatory approval of momelotinib in the United States and other jurisdictions, expand our portfolio of product candidates and prepare for potential commercialization, which will require a significant investment in areas related to contract manufacturing and inventory buildup.\nThe process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for our lead product candidate, momelotinib. The probability of success of our product candidates may be affected by numerous factors, including clinical data, regulatory developments, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization of momelotinib.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related costs, facility-related costs, business insurance, allocated expenses and professional fees for services, including legal, pre-commercialization activities, patent prosecution and maintenance, human resources, audit and accounting services. Personnel-related costs consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, recruitment fees, severance costs and travel costs.\nWe expect to incur additional expenses associated with supporting our growing research and development activities, preparing for potential commercialization, continuing to operate as a public company and other administration and professional services.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities\nOur common stock warrants issued in connection with our November 2019 financing were classified as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and, as such, were re-measured to fair value until January 2020, when they were no longer considered derivative instruments. Changes in fair value, which were directly attributable to changes in the fair value of the underlying stock and discount for lack of marketability, were recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to transactions and monetary asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses may fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In 2019, other income (expense), net also included interest expense associated with our term loan, including final payment and prepayment fees and the full non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs, until its repayment and offering expenses incurred pertaining to the issuance of warrants.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes, net\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes, net consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States, income tax benefit resulting from research and development tax credits in Canada, income taxes in Canada and Australia, as well as deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and changes in related valuation allowance.\nWe did not record a provision for U.S. federal income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our income tax provision relates to income taxes in Canada and Australia and our tax benefit relates to research and development tax credits in Canada. Our net U.S. deferred tax assets continue to be offset by a full valuation allowance.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 3, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue of $0.3 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 pursuant to the upfront fee received from a collaboration agreement (see Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased $8.1 million, from $53.2 million in 2019 to $45.1 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a non-cash charge of $10.5 million that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019, pertaining to an obligation to issue common stock and a warrant to Gilead in consideration for meaningfully reduced royalty rates and elimination of a milestone payment, partially offset by a $1.5 million non-cash charge during the year ended December 31, 2020 to recognize the change in fair value of the securities until their issuance in January 2020. Also contributing to the decrease was a reduction of $7.6 million in clinical trial, third-party manufacturing, and research and preclinical costs for SRA737 and a $0.9 million decrease in personnel-related and allocated overhead costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. These decreased costs were offset by a $9.4 million increase in clinical trial and development costs related to momelotinib for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $6.4 million, from $13.7 million in 2019 to $20.1 million in 2020. The increase was attributable to a $4.9 million increase in personnel-related and allocated overhead costs, including a $3.4 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation and $1.0 million of severance charges that were primarily related to the resignation of an executive, and an increase of $1.5 million in professional fees primarily relating to pre-commercial costs for momelotinib for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities\nThe changes in the fair value of our warrant liabilities were directly attributable to the change in the fair value of the underlying stock and discount for lack of marketability until such time the warrants were no longer considered derivative instruments.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased $0.9 million, from $0.5 million of other expense, net in 2019 to $0.4 million of other income, net in 2020. The change was primarily attributable to offering expenses pertaining to the issuance of warrants of $1.3 million and interest expense incurred on the term loan of $0.9 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. These charges were not incurred in 2020. This change was offset by a $1.2 million decrease in interest income, due to a lower interest rates, and a $0.1 million increase in foreign exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes, net\nNet provision for income taxes of $0.1 million in 2020 and net benefit from income taxes of $0.2 million in 2019 represented foreign income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nSince our inception, we have never generated product revenue and have incurred significant net losses. We have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our common stock and convertible voting preferred stock and accompanying warrants through public offerings (including ATM equity offerings), our convertible and redeemable convertible preferred stock in private financings and, to a lesser extent, through exercises of our preferred stock warrants issued in private financings. Our net losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $80.9 million and $88.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $846.6 million, of which approximately $428.0 million pertained to the revaluation and conversion of redeemable convertible preferred stock upon our initial public offering in July 2015, $37.2 million related to changes in fair value of our Series A and Series B warrant liabilities until their reclassification to equity, and $12.0 million pertained to a securities issuance obligation settled in the first quarter of 2020. Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2020 were cash and cash equivalents of $104.1 million.\nIn November 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of (i) 103,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, that all converted into 7,803,273 shares of common stock in January 2020, (ii) Series A warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,802,241 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to $13.20, and (iii) Series B warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,574,727 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $13.20. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock and the accompanying Series A and Series B warrants were issued at a combined price to the public of $1,000. The aggregate net proceeds received by us from the offering were $97.7 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The Series A warrants contain a cash and/or cashless exercise provision and the Series B warrants may only be exercised by paying the exercise price in cash.\nIn August 2020, we entered into an open market sales agreement, pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to $20.0 million of our common stock from time to time in ATM offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 732,752 shares under the ATM program for proceeds of $8.9 million, net of commissions and offering expenses. In January 2021, we sold an additional 450,000 shares under the ATM program for proceeds of $7.1 million, net of commissions. In addition, in February 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to $30.0 million of our common stock from time to time in ATM offerings.\nWe expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u2022\ninvest to further develop momelotinib, potentially including combination studies as the field of myelofibrosis evolves;\n\u2022\nhire additional clinical, regulatory, scientific, drug development and management personnel, as well as personnel to support any future commercialization efforts;\n\u2022\ninvest in scaling our manufacturing capacity to support development and our global commercialization strategy;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory and marketing approvals for any product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\nachieve regulatory milestones that trigger payments due under our Asset Purchase Agreement with Gilead;\n\u2022\nultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any drugs for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022\nacquire or in-license additional product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\ndevelop additional product candidates;\n\u2022\ndefend against potential lawsuits or other legal issues;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022\nadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel related to commercialization and to continue to operate as a public company.\nTo fund our operating plans, we will need to raise additional capital. Our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient for us to complete development and prepare for commercializing momelotinib. Accordingly, we will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities; however, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current operating plans into the second half of 2022, subject to the potential impact of COVID-19. In addition, Series B warrants, if fully exercised, would provide approximately $34.0 million in proceeds to us. We cannot assure you that the Series B warrants will be exercised, or that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities. However, our forecast for the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our preclinical and clinical development efforts, including any potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical development efforts, costs related to momelotinib commercialization efforts, costs related to potentially develop momelotinib in combination studies or costs to develop additional product candidates.\nWe plan to continue to fund our operating plans\u2019 needs through equity financings or other arrangements, such as strategic partnerships and alliances or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through future equity financings, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or momelotinib or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us. There can be no assurance that such additional financing, if available, can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, we would need to reevaluate our future operating plans. We are exploring options to support the potential continued development of SRA737 in the future. There can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain the funding or support necessary to advance SRA737 or obtain such funding or support on commercially reasonable terms.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nIn 2020, cash used in operating activities of $52.4 million was attributable to a net loss of $80.9 million, partially offset by $27.7 million in non-cash and other adjustments and a net change of $0.8 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges consisted primarily of a $16.2 million change in fair value of our warrant liabilities, a $1.5 million non-cash charge relating to the securities issuable to Gilead in connection with the amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement, and $9.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in our accounts payable of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in our accrued, other and operating lease liabilities of $0.4 million.\nIn 2019, cash used in operating activities of $51.2 million was attributable to a net loss of $88.3 million and a net change of $2.0 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $39.1 million in non-cash and other adjustments. The non-cash and other adjustments consisted primarily of a $20.9 million change in fair value of our warrant liabilities, a $10.5 million non-cash expense relating to the securities issuable to Gilead in connection with the amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement, $5.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, and a $1.7 million reclassification of cash flows, pertaining to the issuance of warrants and repayment of debt, to financing activities. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a decrease in our accrued and other liabilities and operating lease liabilities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for each of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nIn 2020, cash provided by financing activities of $8.9 million consisted of net proceeds (gross proceeds of $9.3 million) from the sale of 732,752 shares under the ATM program.\nIn 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $92.7 million, attributable to net proceeds of $97.7 million received from our November 2019 financing and $0.4 million of proceeds received from the exercise of options to purchase common stock, partially offset by a $5.4 million payment to settle our term loan and related repayment obligations.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, which represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations.\n(1)\nReflects payments we are required to make pursuant to clinical trial and manufacturing agreements.\n(2)\nReflects payments we are required to make under operating lease agreements. Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by base rent of $0.4 million due in the future under sublease agreement. Taxes and other operating costs payable to the landlord and recoverable from the subtenant are not included in the amounts disclosed. (See Note 6 to the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.)\nUnder the terms of the agreements with Gilead and CRT Pioneer Fund LP (CPF), we will be required to pay future milestones if certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. Future milestones for which we cannot reliably estimate the timing have been excluded from the table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management\u2019s judgments and estimates.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue expenses, a significant portion of which are research and development expenses. Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. This process involves the following:\n\u2022\nreviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost;\n\u2022\nestimating and accruing expenses in our financial statements as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at the time; and\n\u2022\nperiodically confirming the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and making adjustments, if necessary.\nEstimated research and development expenses that we accrue include clinical trial costs under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations (CROs), manufacturing costs under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), external research and development expenses incurred under arrangement with third parties and consultants, and license fees for technology that has not reached technological feasibility and does not have an alternative future use.\nWe base our expense accruals related to clinical trials on patient enrollment and our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements vary for each contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on several factors, such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. For service contracts entered into that include a nonrefundable prepayment for service, the upfront payment is deferred and recognized in the statement of operations as the services are rendered.\nContingent milestone payment obligations due to third parties under license and asset purchase agreements are expensed when the milestones are considered probable of occurring. To the extent that an obligation is to be settled by future issuance of securities, the fair value of the instruments is recorded in research and development expense until the securities are issued.\nTo date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of accrued research and development expenses after a reporting period. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials and other research activities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees are measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For stock-based awards that vest subject to the satisfaction of a service requirement, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. For stock-based awards subject to the satisfaction of a service requirement and performance component, the fair value of the award, which is measured on the date of grant, is recognized over the requisite service period as achievement of the performance objective becomes probable. The fair value of any options issued to non-employees is recorded as expense over the vesting period, which is generally the service period.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the estimated fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:\nExpected Term-The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As our historical share option exercise is limited due to a lack of sufficient data points, and does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term, we estimate the expected term by using the midpoint between the weighted-average vesting term and the contractual expiration period of the stock-based award.\nExpected Volatility-The expected volatility is derived from a weighted volatility using both the trading history for our common stock and the historical stock volatilities of peer public companies within our industry that are considered to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the stock-based awards\u2019 expected term.\nExpected Dividend Rate-The expected dividend is zero as we have not paid nor anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nForfeiture Rate-We account for forfeitures when they occur.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected terms utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis.\nWarrant Liabilities\nWarrants for the purchase of shares of our common stock issued in connection with our November 2019 financing were classified as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value on the date of issuance. At the end of each reporting period, changes in estimated fair value during the period were recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. We revalued the warrant liabilities until they ceased to be derivative instruments, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital at their fair value.\nWe estimated the fair value of these liabilities using assumptions that were based on the individual characteristics of the warrants on the valuation dates. We used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of the underlying stock to determine the fair value of these liabilities. The valuation model was based on inputs as of the valuation dates, including the estimated volatility of our stock, the remaining contractual term of the warrants and the risk-free interest rates. An estimated non-marketable discount was also applied if applicable.\nSecurities Issuance Obligation\nThe obligation to issue shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase the same number of shares of common stock pursuant to the amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Gilead was classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair values on the date such obligations arose. At the end of each reporting period, changes in estimated fair values during the period were recognized as research and development expense on our consolidated statement of operations. We adjusted the fair values of the obligations until the securities issuance obligation was settled, at which time the liabilities were reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital at their fair values.\nWe estimated the fair values of these obligations using assumptions that were based on the individual characteristics of the securities to be issued. We used the fair value of the underlying stock and estimated non-marketable discount to determine the common stock issuance obligation, and the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of the underlying stock to determine the fair value of the warrant issuance obligation. The valuation model was based on inputs as of the valuation dates, including the estimated volatility of our stock, the remaining contractual term of the warrants and the risk-free interest rates. An estimated non-marketable discount was also applied if applicable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which includes special purpose entities and other structured finance entities.\nItem 7A.",
    "section_7A": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities and foreign currency risk.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $104.1 million as of December 31, 2020, which consisted primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. While the instruments in our portfolio are of short-term nature and a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact, a zero-rate environment for an extended period of time could adversely affect our results of operations. We do not believe that our cash or cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur consolidated results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A substantial majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars, with the remainder in Canadian Dollars, British Pounds and Australian Dollars. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flow are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative instruments. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchanges rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our operating loss.\nItem 8.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Accounting Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccrued Liabilities and Prepaid Expenses - Management\u2019s Estimates of Accrued and Prepaid Research and Development Costs Associated with Clinical Trials - Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Accounting Matter Description\nThe Company recognizes research and development costs for clinical trials based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided by contract research organizations (CROs) and other third parties. Depending on the timing of payments to providers of research and development services, the Company recognizes prepaid expenses or accrued expenses related to these costs. These prepaid or accrued expenses are based on management\u2019s estimates of the work performed under service agreements and milestones achieved.\nWe identified accrued and prepaid research and development costs related to clinical trials as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management to estimate the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when the Company has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The volume and complexity of the service agreements required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to audit management\u2019s estimates of services performed and costs incurred and evaluating the results of those procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to clinical trial accrued and prepaid expenses include the following, among others:\n\u2022\nWe evaluated publicly available information (such as press releases and investor presentations) and board of directors\u2019 materials regarding the status of clinical trial activities.\n\u2022\nWe made selections of specific amounts recognized as research and development expense as well as those recognized as accrued and prepaid expenses to evaluate management\u2019s estimates of the services performed and costs incurred and performed the following procedures:\n\u2022\nObtained and read the related service agreements, amendments thereto, purchase orders, invoices, or other supporting documentation (such as communications between the Company and CROs).\n\u2022\nPerformed corroborating inquiries with Company management and clinical operations personnel.\n\u2022\nEvaluated management\u2019s judgments compared to the evidence obtained.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\nMarch 11, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\nSIERRA ONCOLOGY, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSIERRA ONCOLOGY, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSIERRA ONCOLOGY, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\n(in thousands, except share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSIERRA ONCOLOGY, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSIERRA ONCOLOGY, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.\nThe Company and Basis of Presentation\nOrganization and Description of Business\nSierra Oncology, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the \u201cCompany\u201d), a Delaware corporation, is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company on a quest to deliver targeted therapies that treat rare forms of cancer. The Company\u2019s main focus is the development of momelotinib, an investigational agent for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Momelotinib is a selective and orally-bioavailable JAK1 (Janus kinase 1), JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and ACVR1 (Activin A receptor type 1) inhibitor with a differentiated mechanism of action that enables it to potentially address all three key manifestations of myelofibrosis: anemia of inflammation, constitutional symptoms and enlarged spleen. Currently, momelotinib is in a global Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with myelofibrosis, called the MOMENTUM study, that if successful will be registration enabling. At its completion, approximately 1,000 myelofibrosis patients will have received momelotinib, and several of our clinical trial patients remain on treatment more than 10 years later.\nThe Company\u2019s portfolio also includes SRA737, a selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), an emerging target for the treatment of cancer which has a key role in the DNA Damage Response (DDR).\nThe Company\u2019s primary activities since inception have been conducting research and development activities, conducting preclinical and clinical testing, recruiting personnel, performing business and financial planning, identifying and evaluating additional drug candidates for potential in-licensing or acquisition, and raising capital to support development activities.\nThe Company has not generated any product revenue related to its primary business purpose to date, nor has it generated any net income, and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which include dependence on key individuals, the need to identify and successfully develop commercially viable products, the need to obtain regulatory approval for its products and commercialize them, and the need to obtain adequate additional financing to fund the development of momelotinib.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $104.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes that its balance of cash and cash equivalents as of the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements is sufficient to fund its current operational plan for at least the next twelve months though it may pursue raising additional capital through equity financings or other arrangements.\nFollow-On Offerings\nOn March 6, 2018, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 546,250 shares of common stock, including the underwriters\u2019 exercise of their overallotment option, at a price to the public of $90.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the offering were $46.0 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $3.2 million.\nOn November 13, 2019, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of (i) 103,000 shares of Series A convertible voting preferred stock (Series A Preferred Stock), (ii) Series A warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,802,241 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $13.20, and (iii) Series B warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,574,727 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $13.20. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock and the accompanying Series A and Series B warrants were issued at a combined purchase price to the public of $1,000. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the offering were $97.7 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $5.3 million. On January 29, 2020, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted into 7,803,273 shares of common stock.\nAt-The-Market Common Stock Offerings\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into an open market sales agreement, pursuant to which it can issue and sell an aggregate of up to $20.0 million of its common stock from time to time in At-The-Market (ATM) offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold 732,752 shares under the ATM program for net proceeds of $8.9 million, net of commissions and offering expenses.\nIn February 2021, the Company filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which it can issue and sell an aggregate of up to $30.0 million of its common stock from time to time in ATM offerings.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn January 21, 2020, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse split of the Company\u2019s common stock (Reverse Stock Split). On January 21, 2020, the Company\u2019s board of directors approved the specific ratio for the Reverse Stock Split, which became effective on January 22, 2020, at 1-for-40. The authorized shares and par value of the common and preferred stock were not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. All issued and outstanding common stock, warrants for common stock, options for common stock and per share amounts contained in the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sierra Oncology, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expense during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to the fair values of stock options and warrants issued, the convertible voting preferred stock and securities issuance obligation, the probability of achieving performance-based milestones of stock options, accruals such as research and development costs, and recoverability of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets, and related valuation allowance. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjusts those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at prevailing exchange rates during the period. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses related to remeasurement are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of funds invested in readily available checking and savings accounts and highly liquid investments in money market funds.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash, which consists of funds invested in a money market fund, represents collateral for a corporate credit card facility and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. All of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held at financial institutions in the United States and Canada that management believes to be of high credit quality. Deposits held in the United States and Canada with these financial institutions exceed federally insured limits.\nThe primary focus of the Company\u2019s investment strategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. The Company\u2019s investment policy addresses the level of credit exposure by limiting the concentration in any one corporate issuer and establishing a minimum allowable credit rating.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values at December 31, 2020 and 2019, due to their short duration. The warrant liabilities and securities issuance obligation contained unobservable inputs that reflected the Company\u2019s own assumptions in which there was little, if any, market activity at the measurement date, thus the Company\u2019s warrant liabilities and securities issuance obligation were measured at their fair values on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs until such time the warrants were no longer considered derivative instruments and the securities issuance obligation was settled.\nThe Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:\nLevel 1-Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\nLevel 2-Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on property and equipment, excluding leasehold improvements, is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term. Depreciation begins at the time the asset is placed in service. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOther Assets\nOther assets consist primarily of restricted cash pledged as collateral for a corporate credit card facility and deferred income tax assets in foreign jurisdictions.\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Asset and Lease Liability\nThe Company recognizes an operating lease with terms greater than one year as right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability on its consolidated balance sheet using the portfolio approach. Lease liability and ROU asset are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the contractual term of the operating lease. The Company utilized its incremental borrowing rate from information available as at the date of initial adoption in determining the present value of the future lease payments. The lease liability and ROU asset are amortized over the term of the lease.\nWarrant Liabilities\nThe Company accounted for its warrants issued in connection with its November 2019 financing based upon the characteristics and provisions of the instruments. Warrants classified as derivative liabilities were recorded on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets at their fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured to fair value on each subsequent reporting period, with the changes in fair value recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company revalued the warrant liabilities until they ceased to be derivative instruments, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital at their fair value. The Company estimated the fair value of these liabilities using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of the underlying stock, as well as assumptions for expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rate. An estimated non-marketable discount was also applied if applicable. Offering expenses arising from the issuance of warrants are expensed as incurred.\nSecurities Issuance Obligation\nThe Company recognized its securities issuance obligation pursuant to the amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) at their fair values on the date such obligations arose. At the end of each reporting period, changes in estimated fair values during the period were recognized as research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company adjusted the fair values of the obligations until the securities issuance obligation was settled, at which time the liabilities were reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital at their fair values. The Company determined the fair values of these obligations based upon the individual characteristics and provisions of the securities to be issued. The Company estimated the fair value of its obligation to issue common stock using the fair value of the underlying stock and a non-marketable discount. The Company estimated the fair value of its obligation to issue warrant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of the underlying stock, as well as assumptions for expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rate. An estimated non-marketable discount was also applied if applicable.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company accounts for non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the goods have been received or when the service has been performed rather than when the payment is made. Depending on the timing of payments to service providers of research and development costs, the Company recognizes prepaid expenses or accrued expenses related to these costs. These prepaid or accrued expenses are based on management\u2019s estimates of the work performed under service agreements and milestones achieved. In the event that a clinical trial is terminated early, the Company records an accrual for the estimated remaining costs to complete the trial in the period of termination.\nUpfront payments made in connection with license and asset purchase agreements are expensed as research and developments costs, as the assets acquired do not have alternative future use. Contingent milestone payment obligations due to third parties under license and asset purchase agreements are expensed when the milestones are considered probable of occurring. To the extent an obligation is to be settled by future issuance of securities, the fair value of these instruments is recorded in research and development expense until the securities are issued.\nResearch and development costs include fees incurred in connection with license and asset purchase agreements and their related amendments, compensation and other related costs for employees engaged in research and development, costs associated with research and preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory activities, manufacturing activities to support clinical activities, fees paid to external service providers that conduct certain research and development, clinical, and manufacturing activities on behalf of the Company and an allocation of overhead expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based payments at fair value, which is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For stock-based awards that vest subject to the satisfaction of a service requirement, the fair value measurement date for stock-based compensation awards is the date of grant and the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally the service period. For stock-based awards that vest subject to the satisfaction of a service requirement and a performance component, the fair value measurement date is the date of grant and the expense is recognized over the requisite service period as achievement of the performance objective becomes probable. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Management makes an assessment of the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Due to the Company\u2019s historical operating performance and the recorded cumulative net losses in prior fiscal periods, the net U.S. deferred tax assets have been offset by a full valuation allowance.\nThe Company recognizes uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which judgment occurs. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer views the Company\u2019s operations and manages its business in one operating segment, which is the business of researching, developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of patients with hematology and oncology needs. Accordingly, the Company has a single reporting segment.\n3.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period without consideration for common stock equivalents. In 2019, preferred stock with characteristics of common stock was also included in the determination of the weighted average. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, stock options and warrants for common stock are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive.\nThe following shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because including them would have been antidilutive:\nAlso excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share are 450,000 shares of common stock issued by the Company in January 2021, under its ATM program for proceeds of $7.1 million, net of commissions.\n4.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures and reports its cash equivalents, restricted cash, warrant liabilities and securities issuance obligation at fair value. The following table sets forth the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy:\nMoney market funds and restricted money market funds are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices and are classified as a Level 1 input.\nThe Company\u2019s warrant liabilities and securities issuance obligation contained unobservable inputs that reflected the Company\u2019s own assumptions in which there was little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s warrant liabilities and securities issuance obligation were measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs at each reporting period. The warrant liabilities and securities issuance obligation were classified as Level 3 inputs. These liabilities were shown as current liabilities on the balance sheet until such time the warrants were no longer considered derivative instruments and the securities issuance obligation was settled.\nThe fair values of the Series A and Series B warrants were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected terms represented the periods that the warrants are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rates were based on the U.S. Constant Maturity treasury curve commensurate with the time to expiry. The expected dividend was zero as the Company has not paid nor does it anticipate paying any dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. The expected volatilities were estimated by backsolving to volatility implied in the transaction price. Discount for lack of marketability was dependent on the restriction period and the estimated volatility during the period.\nThe fair value of the warrant issuance obligation was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected term represented the period that the underlying warrant is expected to be outstanding from the time the issuance obligation arose. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Constant Maturity treasury curve commensurate with the time to expiry. The expected dividend was zero as the Company has not paid nor does it anticipate paying any dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. The expected volatility was estimated by backsolving to volatility implied in the transaction price. The fair value of the common stock issuance obligation was estimated based on the fair value of the underlying common stock. Discount for lack of marketability was dependent on the restriction period and the estimated volatility during the period.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair values at the end of the reporting period represent the Company\u2019s best estimate. However, inherent uncertainties are involved. If factors or assumptions change, the estimated fair values could be materially different.\nAt November 13, 2019, upon the issuance of Series A and Series B warrants and when the securities issuance obligation arose, the Company estimated the fair values of the financial liabilities using the following assumptions:\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company remeasured these liabilities to their fair values using the following assumptions:\nAt January 22, 2020, Series A and Series B warrants were no longer considered to be derivative instruments. The Company remeasured the fair value of the warrant liabilities at the time of reclassification to equity using the following assumptions:\nAt January 31, 2020, the securities issuance obligation was settled by the issuance of common stock and a common stock warrant. The Company remeasured the fair value of its common stock issuance obligation based on the value of the common stock at the time of issuance. The warrant issuance obligation was remeasured using the following assumptions:\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in the estimated fair values of the Company\u2019s Level 3 financial liabilities, which were measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs:\nFluctuations in fair values of the financial liabilities were attributable to changes in the fair value of the underlying stock and non-marketable discount.\nThere were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n5.\nBalance Sheet Components\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of the following:\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the consolidated balance sheets to the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following:\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment, net consists of the following:\nDepreciation related to the Company\u2019s property and equipment for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0.1 million.\nAccrued and Other Liabilities\nAccrued and other liabilities consist of the following:\n6.\nLeases\nThe Company entered into an operating lease agreement to lease the office space in Vancouver, Canada commencing March 1, 2018. The lease expires on February 28, 2023. In December 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sublet the entire office premises to a third party until February 27, 2023. Pursuant to the sublease agreement, the subtenant will pay base rent of $0.2 million per annum and all operating costs to the Company. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe components of lease expense, which are recorded in general and administrative expense, and related cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nThe total rent expense was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate for the operating lease are 2.2 years and 6.5%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, maturities of lease liability due under the lease agreement are as follows:\nIn addition to base rent, this lease requires payment of operating costs. These costs are not included in the table above.\nIn December 2020, the Company entered into a 48-month operating lease agreement to lease office space in San Mateo, California. The lease has not commenced as of December 31, 2020. The Company\u2019s obligation under this office lease is $0.1 million for 2021, $0.2 million for each of 2022, 2023 and 2024, and $0.1 million for 2025.\n7.\nTerm Loan\nIn August 2018, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (Loan Agreement) with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Contemporaneously with executing the Loan Agreement, the Company drew down the first $5.0 million tranche. In December 2019, the Company repaid the $5.0 million term loan and paid the prepayment and final payment fees of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company issued a warrant to SVB to purchase 1,839 of the Company\u2019s common stock at a price per share of $74.80. The warrant was immediately exercisable, will expire on August 21, 2028, contains a cashless exercise provision and is classified as equity.\nNo interest expense was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recognized interest expense related to the Loan Agreement of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, including the final payment fee, the prepayment fee and the unamortized portion of the debt issuance costs. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.2 million.\n8.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAsset Purchase Agreement\nIn August 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Gilead whereby the Company acquired worldwide rights to the pharmaceutical product momelotinib, an investigational orally-bioavailable JAK1, JAK2 and ACVT1 inhibitor together with all related intellectual property rights and certain other related assets. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company made a one-time upfront payment of $3.0 million in August 2018. The related expense was included in research and development for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In October 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement in which the Company agreed to issue, subject to certain conditions, shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock to Gilead in consideration for meaningfully reduced royalty rates and elimination of a near term milestone payment in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the amended agreement, milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $190.0 million may become payable to Gilead upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestone events and the Company is required to pay Gilead low double-digit to high-teens percent tiered combined royalties based upon net sales.\nIn connection with obligations under the amendment, the Company recognized a $10.5 million non-cash research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 based on the fair value of the securities to be issued. On January 31, 2020, the Company fulfilled its obligation to issue securities by entering into a securities purchase agreement with Gilead, pursuant to which the Company issued to Gilead 725,283 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and a warrant to purchase 725,283 shares of common stock at a price per share of $13.20. The warrant is immediately exercisable, will expire on January 31, 2025 and contains a cash and/or cashless exercise provision. Upon remeasurement of the securities issuance obligation immediately prior to the issuance, an additional $1.5 million of non-cash research and development expense, representing changes in fair value of the securities since December 31, 2019, was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 4, Fair Value Measurement for further discussions in valuation techniques.\nLicense Agreements\nIn September 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with CRT Pioneer Fund LP (CPF) for worldwide rights, know-how and materials to develop SRA737, a small molecule inhibitor targeting Chk1, a promising therapeutic target to treat cancer. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company made a one-time upfront payment of $7.0 million to CPF in October 2016 and paid $2.0 million to CPF in January 2017 for the successful transfer of two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials. Pursuant to the original license agreement, additional milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $319.5 million may have become payable to CPF upon the achievement of certain milestones. In November 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the license agreement with CPF, which amended the terms and reduced the amounts of certain future milestones. Pursuant to the amended agreement, future milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $290.0 million may become payable to CPF upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, including a milestone payment of $2.0 million upon the dosing of the first patient of the first trial of SRA737 following the effective date of the amendment. These milestones will be accrued once they are considered probable of occurring. In addition, the Company is required to pay CPF, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on the net sales of any product successfully developed.\nIn May 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (Carna License Agreement) with Carna Biosciences, Inc. (Carna) for worldwide rights to develop and commercialize SRA141, a small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting Cdc7. In exchange for this exclusive right, the Company paid Carna an upfront payment of $0.9 million in June 2016. In June 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (Carna Collaboration Agreement) with Carna effectively terminating the Carna License Agreement. Pursuant to the Carna Collaboration Agreement, Carna paid an upfront fee of $0.3 million, which was recognized as collaboration revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 by the Company, for the exclusive worldwide rights for SRA141 and other transition services. In addition, the Company may be entitled to single-digit royalties on product sales, on a product-by-product basis, and low to mid-teen profit share on royalty and non-royalty income.\nLegal\nFrom time to time, the Company may become subject to other legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company may receive letters alleging infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights. The Company is not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings, nor is it aware of any pending or threatened litigation that, in the Company\u2019s opinion, would have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.\nCOVID-19\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets, economies worldwide and our business is highly uncertain. Research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses may vary significantly if there is an increased impact from COVID-19 on the costs and timing associated with the conduct of clinical trials and other related business activities. The Company is carefully monitoring the pandemic and the potential length and depth of the resulting economic impact on its financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was not aware of any contingencies and no related estimates were recorded on its financial statements as a result of COVID-19.\n9.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company is required to reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock a number of shares sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding preferred stock, options granted and available for grant under the incentive plans, shares reserved for issuance under the employee stock purchase plan and issued warrant.\n10.\nPreferred Stock\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $0.001. There were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 103,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nSeries A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock\nOn November 13, 2019, the Company completed an underwritten public offering whereby it issued 103,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock together with Series A warrants and Series B warrants for a combined purchase price of $1,000. The aggregate proceeds received by the Company was $97.7 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock was convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock equal to the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock of $1,000 divided by the voting conversion price of $13.20. On January 29, 2020, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted into 7,803,273 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n11.\nWarrant Liabilities\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s November 2019 public offering of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company issued Series A warrants to purchase up to 7,802,241 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $13.20, and Series B warrants to purchase up to 2,574,727 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $13.20. Both Series A and Series B warrants are exercisable following stockholder approval in January 2020 of an increase in authorized common stock sufficient to allow for the exercise of the warrants, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations. The Series A warrants will expire five years from the date they first became exercisable or on January 22, 2025 and contain a cash and/or cashless exercise provision. The Series B warrants will expire on the 75th day anniversary following the announcement of top-line data from the Company\u2019s MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial of momelotinib and may only be exercised by paying the exercise price in cash, which would amount to approximately $34.0 million in proceeds to the Company if fully exercised.\nThe Company revalued the warrant liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model until they ceased to be derivative instruments, following stockholder approval of an increase in authorized common stock sufficient to allow for the exercise of the warrants, at which time they were reclassified to equity. The fair values of the Series A and Series B warrants at the time of issuance in November 2019, at December 31, 2019 and at the time they ceased to be derivative instruments in January 2020 were estimated to be $25.0 million, $45.9 million and $62.1 million, respectively. The Company recorded a $16.2 million and $20.9 million non-cash expense relating to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (see Note 4).\n12.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for its employees and non-employees as follows:\nDetermination of Fair Value\nThe estimated grant-date fair value of all the Company\u2019s stock-based awards was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on the following assumptions:\nThe fair value of each stock option grant was determined by the Company on the date of grant using the methods and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment and estimation by management.\nExpected Term-The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As the Company\u2019s historical share option exercise is limited due to a lack of sufficient data points, and does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term, the expected term is derived by using the midpoint between the weighted-average vesting term and the contractual expiration period of the stock-based award.\nExpected Volatility-The expected volatility is derived from a weighted volatility using both the Company\u2019s trading history for its common stock and the historical stock volatilities of peer public companies within its industry that are considered to be comparable to the Company\u2019s business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the stock-based awards\u2019 expected term.\nExpected Dividend Rate-The expected dividend is zero as the Company has not paid nor anticipate paying any dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future.\nForfeiture Rate-The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur.\nEquity Incentive Plans\n2018 Equity Inducement Plan\nIn September 2018, the Company\u2019s Compensation Committee approved the 2018 Equity Inducement Plan (2018 Plan). The number of shares available for awards under the 2018 Plan was set to 37,500. On June 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the 2018 Plan to increase the authorized number of shares available for issuance by 500,000 shares. As of December 31, 2020, 537,500 shares were reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan. On February 3, 2021, the Company\u2019s Compensation Committee approved an amendment to the 2018 Plan to increase the authorized number of shares available for issuance by 500,000. The exercise price of each stock-based award issued under the 2018 Plan is required to be no less than the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock. The vesting and exercise provisions of options or restricted awards granted are determined individually with each grant. Stock options have a 10-year life and expire if not exercised within that period or if not exercised within three months of cessation of employment with the Company or such longer period of time as specified in the option agreement.\n2015 Plan\nThe 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan) became effective on July 14, 2015. On January 21, 2020, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the following amendments to the 2015 Plan: (i) increase to the authorized number of shares available for issuance by 4,312,500 shares and proportionately increase the share limit related to incentive stock options, (ii) provide limits on the total value of compensation that may be granted to any non-employee director in each calendar year, and (iii) eliminate the annual individual grant limit to reflect changes to the tax law in 2017 tax legislation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 4,678,597 shares were reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan will increase automatically on January 1 of each calendar year 2016 through 2025 by the number of shares equal to 4% of the total outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors or Compensation Committee may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. The exercise price of each stock-based award issued under the 2015 Plan is required to be no less than the fair value of the Company\u2019s capital stock. The vesting and exercise provisions of options or restricted awards granted are determined individually with each grant. Stock options have a 10-year life and expire if not exercised within that period or if not exercised within three months of cessation of employment with the Company or such longer period of time as specified in the option agreement, unless modified.\n2008 Plan\nThe Company granted options under the 2008 Stock Plan (2008 Plan) until July 2015 when it was terminated as to future awards, although it continues to govern the terms of options that remain outstanding under the 2008 Plan. The 2008 Plan provided for the granting of Incentive Stock Options (ISO), nonqualified stock options and stock purchase rights. In connection with the Board of Director\u2019s approval of the 2015 Plan, all remaining shares available for future award under the 2008 Plan were transferred to the 2015 Plan, and the 2008 Plan was terminated. A summary of activity under the 2008 Plan, 2015 Plan and 2018 Plan and related information is as follows:\nThe weighted-average grant date fair values of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $8.81, $50.40 and $70.00 per share. There were no options exercised for the year ended December 31, 2020. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The total grant date fair value of options vested for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $5.2 million, $6.0 million and $5.9 million.\nIn May 2020, the Company entered into a separation agreement with Dr. Glover, the Company\u2019s former President and Chief Executive Officer, in connection with his resignation. Pursuant to the separation agreement, Dr. Glover\u2019s unvested options that would have vested during the one-year period from the date of separation accelerated and vested immediately. The vesting date of all remaining unvested options accelerated by one year, and vested in accordance with the accelerated vesting schedule through December 31, 2020. All unvested options were cancelled on December 31, 2020. Furthermore, Dr. Glover received an extension of the expiration date of his vested stock options to 75 days following the Company\u2019s announcement of the top-line data results from its MOMENTUM clinical trial. Compensation costs relating to the vesting acceleration and the modifications to option terms was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn August 2020, the Company granted executives and employees 1,107,250 stock options with performance-based conditions. Vesting is achieved based upon the satisfaction of pre-determined milestones. As of December 31, 2020, all of the performance-based options remain unvested. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company has recognized approximately $0.9 million in stock-based compensation expense relating to certain performance-based criteria that are considered probable of occurring.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to unvested stock options was $23.1 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a remaining weighted-average period of 3.1 years. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to unvested stock options with performance-based conditions was $8.9 million.\n2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company adopted the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and initially reserved 17,500 shares of common stock as of its effective date of July 15, 2015. The aggregate number of shares issued over the term of the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will not exceed 85,000 shares of common stock. The ESPP will not become effective until such time as the Compensation Committee determines in the future, and as of December 31, 2020, the initial offering periods had not commenced. As of December 31, 2020, no shares of common stock have been issued to employees participating in the ESPP and 17,500 shares were available for issuance under the ESPP.\n13.\nIncome Taxes\nThe geographical breakdown of loss before provision for income taxes is as follows:\nThe components of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes are as follows:\nThe reconciliation between income taxes computed at the federal statutory income tax rate and the provision for (benefit from) income taxes is as follows:\nThe components of the deferred tax assets are as follows:\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of these assets is more likely than not. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes historical operating performance and the recorded cumulative net losses in prior fiscal periods, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance of $35.2 million and $16.4 million against the net U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The U.S. net valuation allowance increased by $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The U.S. net valuation allowance decreased by $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing U.S. deferred tax assets. Based on the weight of all evidence, including a history of operating losses and the Company\u2019s ability to generate future taxable income to realize the assets, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nUtilization of the Company\u2019s net operating loss and U.S. research and development credit carryforwards to offset taxable income are subject to an annual limitation, pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Sections 382 and 383. As a result of ownership changes that have occurred, the most recent which occurred during 2019, certain of the Company\u2019s tax attributes existing as of the date of the ownership change are not be available for future use. The loss of these attributes did not have any impact on the financial statements since the net U.S. deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had gross U.S. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of $54.8 million, that are eligible for an indefinite carryforward, and gross state operating loss carryforwards of $52.4 million expiring in years ranging from 2022 to 2040. The Company also has U.S. net tax credit carryforwards of $4.6 million which begin to expire in 2039 and net tax credit carryforwards in a foreign jurisdiction of $0.5 million which begin to expire in 2038.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe activity related to the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nIf recognized, gross unrecognized tax benefits would not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate due to the Company\u2019s full valuation allowance position on the U.S. deferred tax assets. From time to time, the Company is subject to review by tax authorities. It is not possible to estimate the impact of changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. However, the Company does not expect the changes, if any, to be materially different from what is recorded and will adjust its estimate and liability as necessary.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not recognize any accrued interest and penalties.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various states, Canada and Australia. Tax years 2017 through 2019 remain open to examination by the United States, various state jurisdictions and Canada. The tax year ended December 31, 2019 remains open to examination in Australia. The Company is not under examination in any tax jurisdiction for any year.\n14.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nThe following tables present certain selected unaudited consolidated quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters ended December 31, 2020. This consolidated quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments necessary to state fairly the information for the periods presented. The selected consolidated quarterly financial results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth therein.\n(1)\nNet loss from continuing operations and net loss attributable to holders of common stock and preferred stock with characteristics of common stock are the same as net loss for all periods presented.\n(2)\nNet loss for the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 included a $16.2 million and $20.9 million non-cash charge, respectively, relating to changes in fair value of warrant liabilities (see Note 11) and a $1.5 million and $10.5 million non-cash charge, respectively, relating to the Company\u2019s obligation to issue securities pursuant to an amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Gilead (see Note 8).\nItem 9.",

    "section_9A": "Item 9A.\nControls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2020, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nAny controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in \u201cInternal Control-Integrated Framework\u201d issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.",
