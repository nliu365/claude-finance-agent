    "section_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nSigmaRenoPro was incorporated on June 16, 2017. Our fiscal year end is June 30, and we have no subsidiaries. Our business offices are currently located at Aloni Noa\u2019kh St. 1, Kiryat Motzkin 26402, Israel. Omar Aamar, has served as our President, Treasurer and a director since June 16, 2017. Mr. Amar\u2019s spouse, Hosnieh Aaman, has served as our Secretary since July 25, 2017. Mr. Aamar holds 2,300,000 shares, or 51/1% of the issued and outstanding,common stock of the Company. Mr. Aamar\u2019s business experience is in the construction and home building industry in Israel. We are focusing on matching home project owners with contractors in the United States. Mr. Aamar, however, has no knowledge of and no experience in this business in the United States. The Company is focusing its operations in the United States because the Company\u2019s believes the barriers to operation of its business in the United States is not burdensome and the United States has a large home repair market.\nDuring the current year we have generated $0. As of June 30, 2020, our assets were $6,404 and our liabilities were $15,723. Our net loss for the period of inception on June 16, 2017 to June 30, 2020, was $82,719.\nWe plan to provide a U.S.-based service matching homeowners that have renovation projects with professionally-skilled contractors, initially concentrating our efforts on the four consumer regions of the United States of, New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; Chicago Illinois; and Houston Texas. Our customized match making service helps homeowners converge with professional contractors. We plan to create a collection of articles intended to help homeowners with home project information, including:\n\u2022 How to outline project requirements;\n\u2022 How to select the right contractor;\n\u2022 How to interview contractors;\n\u2022 How to draw up a project contract; and\n\u2022 How to settle disputes with contractors\nOur service is deigned to be free for all homeowners to use and post their projects. We plan to build a network of professionally-skilled contractors who provide a broad array of construction and renovation services for everything from changing light fixtures to complete kitchen renovation, and from housecleaning services to new construction.\nMatching projects and homeowners with the right service provider\nHomeowners will be provided a unique experience at SigmaRenoPro. User-friendly tools will be made available without charge, to post home renovation and other project requirements online. Our matchmaking program matches the homeowner\u2019s location and project requirements to qualified contractors with expertise in that area. Our exclusive lead-generation service alerts each service provider candidate via e-mail or text. They in turn have the option to contact the homeowner and place a bid on the project.\nSelecting the right service professional\nWe will help select the right contractor for the job. In addition to listing each service provider\u2019s merits on their profile page for our users to cross-check, our user interface will be designed to offer reviews to help ensure they're posted by real clients and real people.\nWe will also offer free access to helpful articles found only at SigmaRenoPro that will offer information to users, including:\n\u2022 How to critique contractors;\n\u2022 How to select the right contractor for the job;\n\u2022 How to effectively interview contractors;\n\u2022 How to draw up a project contract;\n\u2022 The importance of building code regulation requirements;\n\u2022 Contract/contractual labor terminology;\n\u2022 How to settle disputes with contractors;\n\u2022 How to help ensure the job gets done right; and\n\u2022 What to avoid in a contractor.\nWe also intend to have a Ratings & Reviews section, as well as testimonials from past clients, stating whether or not they were satisfied with the services rendered by member contractors.\nRatings& Reviews\nOne of the most important services we intend to offer our members is the \u201cword of mouth\u201d feedback from homeowners. For each project description placed at SigmaRenoPro, the homeowner be asked to submit a Ratings & Reviews survey for the service provider you selected to complete the job. We believe that providing this information will help other homeowners make their service provider selection, and that information provided by Ratings & Reviews will contribute to the online community we intend to build. We also believe that the content of our Ratings & Reviews section will help us keep track of the quality of service provided by our member contractor, thereby providing valuable information that benefits other homeowners.\nOur Web Site\nWe intend to create a website as the primary means through which we intend to conduct out business. The website will have a \u201cMy Account\u201d feature, which will be a personal web space at SigmaRenoPro, provided free of charge to users A secure section where you keep your profile information. From an account, a user will be able to:\n\u2022 Add your address, phone number, or e-mail address to your personal profile\n\u2022 Update your profile information at any time\n\u2022 Post and manage job details\n\u2022 Communicate with member contractors\nCanceling a contract\nIf a homeowner or service professional decides to end or alter a project, the terms of such termination or change to an existing project will be have to be agreed upon between the user and the service professional hired by the user. In the case of such termination, the Company believes that a user should expect to pay for work completed and materials purchased up to the point. To help avoid misunderstandings that could result in a project\u2019s termination, the Company believes that specific project information should be detailed in a formal contract. This would include, but not be limited to the project description, materials to be used, start and finish dates between the project owner and service professional.\nScreening Process for Service Professionals\nTo keep our services free to homeowners, our screening process is minimal. We will ask contractors to provide accurate experience and licensing information. We will also ask that they keep information on their profile page updated. We will ask homeowners to validate member service professionals\u2019 licensing, insurance, and references themselves, and believe that by doing so, we help enable homeowners to make better hiring decisions increase the chance of project success. Additionally, homeowners will have the personal assurance of verifying the accuracy of such information about the member service provider.\nThe difference between a licensed service professional and a non-licensed service professional\nLicensing means that the service professional has been authorized by the province or local government to work within his or her trade or profession. Licensing requirements vary province-to-province; not all trades or job sizes require a license.\nPricing\nOur services are designed to be free to homeowners. Service professionals will be required to pay an advertising fee to participate in SigmaRenoPro\u2019s network. Each service provider will be required to complete a profile, specifying the type of work they perform, their areas of expertise and experience, and the geographical areas they serve. We will provide lead generation services; new customer leads that match the service professional\u2019s criteria. We will charge service professional pays a monthly subscription fee of $49.00 to access the leads which originate from our service.\nTreatment of personal information\nBy inputting information into secure online forms, only the intended party is allowed to translate the encoded information. We plan to be selected to secure personal information on our serves by using SSL (secure socket layer) technology and secure server software. SSL is an industry standard for protecting web communications. The SSL security protocol provides some data encryption, server authentication and message integrity.\nA secure server is the software used to navigate the Internet and has been created to encrypt, or scramble, all information until the authorized recipient can unscramble it. Information is scrambled by a mathematical formula using 128-bit encryption. When viewing any Web page, a lock icon near the lower-right corner of the window indicates whether the entire contents of the page is protected by encryption while it is being received by your computer. When a closed lock icon appears, then the page is protected by encryption. When a broken lock icon appears, then the page is not protected by encryption.\nCompetition and competitive strategy\nWe expect that we will compete for members with traditional, offline consumer resources, and with online providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals on the basis of a number of factors, including breadth of our service provider listings, reliability of our content, breadth, depth and timeliness of information and strength and recognition of our brand. We believe that we will face extensive challenges in attempting to compete because we do not have the ability to verify who is purchasing services that compete with ours, at what cost, and the terms and conditions under which our competitors are offering our services. We believe that the market for our services is constantly changing in terms of how business who offer our services are able to sell such services to home owners.\nPatents, trademarks, licenses, franchise restrictions and contractual obligations & concessions\nWe rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks. We do not own patents.\nCompliance with government regulation\nWe will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business, however, any government regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.\nResearch and development activities and costs\nWe have not incurred any research and development costs to date.\nEmployees and employment agreements\nOmar Aamar, our sole officer and director, is our only employee, and he currently works full time on Company matters.\nItem 1A.",

(the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company\u2019s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company\u2019s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose.\nOrganization, Nature of Business and Trade Name\nSigmarenopro, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 16, 2017. Sigmarenopro, Inc. intends to provide home project owners with contractor match making services in the U.S. Their customized match making service helps homeowners converge with professional contractors. They also intend to create a collection of articles intended to help homeowners with home project information, including how to outline project requirements, select the right contractor, interview contractors, draw up a project contract and settle disputes with contractors. Their service is deigned to be free for all homeowners to use and post their projects and plan to build a network of professionally-skilled contractors who provide a broad array of construction and renovation services for everything from changing light fixtures to complete kitchen renovation, and from housecleaning services to new construction.\nThe Company\u2019s principal office is in Kiryat Motzkin, Israel.\nThe Company\u2019s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the Company\u2019s website and apps before another company develops similar websites or apps.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at June 30, 2020 and for the related periods presented.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period.\nDepreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are:\nFor federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.\nThe Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605-35 \u201cRevenue Recognition\u201d. Revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenues on sales of its services, based on the terms of the customer agreement. The customer agreement takes the form of either a contract or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price. If the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the customer.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\u2019s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nIn accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the carrying value of loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements\u2019 estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Sigmarenopro, Inc.\u2019s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Sigmarenopro, Inc.\u2019s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.\nCapital Stock\nThe Company has authorized Seventy Five Million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Four Million Five Hundred and Thousand (4,500,000) shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes.\nNOTE B - GOING CONCERN\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.\nUnder the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nDuring the next year, the Company\u2019s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with app development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.\nHistorically, it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company\u2019s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company\u2019s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.\nIn the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock.

    "section_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nAs of June 30, 2020, Chief Executive Officer of the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a - 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Sec. 240.13a-15 or 240.15d-15 the disclosure controls and procedures have been found to be not effective.\nThe Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed under the securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nEvaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO (2013). The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company\u2019s internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring. In management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), our management concluded as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that our internal control over financial reporting has not been effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2020 that have materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to materially impact, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material impact on the financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures, or the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting, will necessarily prevent all fraud and material errors. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems, the Company\u2019s internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of internal control is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances, or because the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020 , under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), and determined that controls are ineffective due to the Company\u2019s small size and lack of segregation of duties.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report by our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only our management report in this annual report.\nItem 9B.",
