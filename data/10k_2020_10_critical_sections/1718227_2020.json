    "section_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nWe are a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the construction and maintenance of roadways across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we provide a variety of products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and residential developments. Consistent with our vertical integration strategy, our primary operations consist of (i) manufacturing and distributing hot mix asphalt (\u201cHMA\u201d) for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with construction projects, (ii) paving activities, including the construction of roadway base layers and application of asphalt pavement, (iii) site development, including the installation of utility and drainage systems, (iv) mining aggregates, such as sand and gravel, that are used as raw materials in the production of HMA, and (v) distributing liquid asphalt cement for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with HMA production.\nConstruction Partners, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2007 as a holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Construction Partners Holdings, Inc., to facilitate an acquisition growth strategy in the HMA paving and construction industry. On December 31, 2019, Construction Partners Holdings, Inc. merged with and into Construction Partners, Inc., with Construction Partners, Inc. surviving the merger.\nAs used in this report, the terms \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d refer to Construction Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except when the context requires that those terms mean only the parent company or a particular subsidiary.\n2020 Fiscal Year Developments\n\u2022Florida Acquisitions. We completed two acquisitions in Florida during the fiscal year, resulting in the addition of three HMA plants in Pensacola, DeFuniak Springs and Palm City, Florida. Both acquired businesses were located near or adjacent to markets in which we had preexisting operations and have benefited from those geographic synergies. These acquisitions have allowed us to serve new markets in central Florida and the western Florida panhandle.\n\u2022Amendment to Credit Agreement. On July 30, 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with BBVA USA (\u201cBBVA\u201d) and certain other lenders party thereto, which amended and restated our preexisting credit agreement (as amended and restated, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) and a revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). The July 2020 amendment and restatement, among other things, increased the aggregate amount of the lender commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan and made certain other amendments and modifications to the terms of the Credit Agreement, including with respect to interest rate and our schedule for repayment of indebtedness thereunder. For more information about the Credit Agreement, see Note 11 - Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n\u2022COVID-19. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including its impact on our customers, employees, suppliers, and vendors. We did not incur significant disruptions from COVID-19 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as road construction has been designated a \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d industry and an \u201cessential business\u201d in each state within our footprint, which has allowed us to continue to operate without significant delays related to state and local shelter-in-place orders. However, due to the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position, operating results and cash flows in future periods. We continue to monitor risks to our business and to funding levels for transportation infrastructure arising from increasing transmission rates of COVID-19 and measures adopted by governmental and healthcare authorities to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, as further described in Item 1A.",
    "section_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our Class A common stock involves risks. You should carefully read and consider the following risks, as well as all of the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to our Business\nA significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions, particularly in the southeastern United States, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe currently operate in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. A significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions or uncertainty regarding the economic outlook in the United States generally, or in any of these states particularly, could reduce demand for infrastructure projects. Demand for infrastructure projects depends on overall economic conditions, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state and local government spending levels. In particular, low tax revenues, credit rating downgrades, budget deficits and financing constraints, including timing and amount of federal funding and competing governmental priorities, could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new public infrastructure projects. In addition, any instability in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, for work on projects already in progress, could cause our customers to delay or cancel construction projects in our contract backlog, and could create difficulties for customers to obtain adequate financing to fund new construction projects, including through the issuance of municipal bonds.\nOur business depends on federal, state and local government spending for public infrastructure construction, and reductions in government funding could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we generated approximately 65.3% of our construction contract revenues from publicly funded construction projects at the federal, state and local levels. As a result, if publicly funded construction decreases due to reduced federal, state or local funding or otherwise, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nFederal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent the maximum amounts available for federally funded construction projects. Each year, Congress passes an appropriation act establishing the amount that can be used for particular programs. The annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the federal Highway Trust Fund. Once Congress passes the annual appropriation, the federal government distributes funds to each state based on formulas or other procedures. States generally must spend these funds on the specific programs outlined in the federal legislation. In recent years, the Highway Trust Fund has faced\ninsolvency as outlays have outpaced revenues. Annual shortfalls have been addressed primarily by short-term measures. As a result, we cannot be assured of the existence, timing or amount of future federal highway funding. Federal highway funding is also subject to uncertainties associated with congressional spending as a whole, including the potential impacts of budget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. Any reduction in federal highway funding, particularly in the amounts allocated to states in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. While the incoming administration has announced an infrastructure stimulus plan, we cannot predict the impact, if any, that it or other proposed changes in law and regulations may have on our business.\nEach state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various state taxes, typically fuel taxes and vehicle fees, as well as from voter-approved bond programs. Shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amount spent or delay expenditures on state infrastructure projects. Many states have experienced state-level funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects. To address these pressures, some states have adopted measures to promote stable funding for infrastructure investment, including special-purpose taxes and increased fuel taxes. Any reduction in state infrastructure funding in the states in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from state DOTs. The loss of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully contract with state DOTs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur largest customers are state DOTs. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Alabama DOT and the North Carolina DOT accounted for 11.6% and 7.8% of our revenues, respectively, and projects performed for all DOTs accounted for 32.5% of our revenues. We believe that we will continue to rely on state DOTs for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The loss or reduction of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully contract with a state DOT could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and liquidity. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, Concentration of Risks, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for information relating to concentrations of revenues by type of customer and for a description of our largest customers.\nGovernment contracts generally are subject to a variety of governmental regulations, requirements and statutes, the violation or alleged violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur contracts with governmental agencies are generally subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting and often include express or implied certifications of compliance. We may be subject to claims for civil or criminal fraud for actual or alleged violations of these governmental regulations, requirements or statutes. In addition, we may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. Further, if we fail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, or if we have a substantial number of workplace safety violations, our existing government contracts could be terminated, and we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. Even if we have not violated these regulations, requirements or statutes, allegations of violations or defending qui tam litigation could harm our reputation and require us to incur material costs to defend any such allegations or lawsuits. Any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe cancellation of a significant number of contracts, our disqualification from bidding on new contracts and the unpredictable timing of new project opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment contracts typically can be canceled at any time, with us receiving payment only for the work completed. The cancellation of an unfinished contract could result in lost revenues and cause our equipment to be idled for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available. In addition, we could be prohibited from bidding on certain government contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities. For example, various laws, including those governing wages, benefits, overtime, working conditions, equal employment opportunity, affirmative action and drug testing, provide for mandatory suspension and/or debarment of contractors in certain circumstances involving violations of those laws. In addition, federal and state laws provide for discretionary suspension and/or debarment in certain circumstances, including as a result of being convicted of, or being found civilly liable for, fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain or performing a public contract or subcontract. The scope and duration of any suspension or debarment may vary depending upon the facts of a particular case and the grounds for debarment. Finally, the timing of project awards is unpredictable and outside of our control. Project awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, revenues or costs on our projects, we may incur contract losses or achieve lower profits than anticipated.\nPricing on fixed unit price contracts is based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual costs, and contracts with a fixed total price require that the work be performed for an agreed-upon price irrespective of our actual costs. We only generate profits on fixed unit price and fixed total price contracts when our revenues exceed our actual costs, which requires us to accurately estimate our costs, control our actual costs and avoid cost overruns. If our cost estimates are too low or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur a loss or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. The costs incurred and profit realized, if any, on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the failure to include materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a fixed total price contract;\n\u2022delays caused by weather conditions or otherwise failing to meet scheduled acceptance dates;\n\u2022contract or project modifications or conditions creating unanticipated costs that are not covered by change orders;\n\u2022changes in the availability, proximity and costs of materials, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction materials, as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;\n\u2022to the extent not covered by contractual cost escalators, variability in, and our inability to predict, the costs of diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and cement;\n\u2022the availability and skill level of workers;\n\u2022onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;\n\u2022the failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers or customers to perform their obligations;\n\u2022fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, customers or our own personnel;\n\u2022mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;\n\u2022citations issued by a government authority, including OSHA or MSHA;\n\u2022difficulties in obtaining required government permits or approvals;\n\u2022changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022uninsured claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part; and\n\u2022public infrastructure customers seeking to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions that result in increased risks to us.\nThese and other factors may cause us to incur losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nBecause our industry is capital-intensive and we have significant fixed and semi-fixed costs, our profitability is sensitive to changes in volume.\nThe property, plants and equipment needed to produce our products and provide our services can be very expensive. We must spend a substantial amount of capital to purchase and maintain such assets. Although we believe our current cash balance, along with our projected internal cash flows and available financing sources, will provide sufficient cash to support our currently anticipated operating and capital needs, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to purchase and maintain the property, plants and equipment necessary to operate our business, or if the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed, we may be required to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, due to the level of fixed and semi-fixed costs associated with our business, particularly at our HMA production facilities, volume decreases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy, to successfully integrate acquired businesses and to retain key employees of acquired businesses.\nSince our inception, we have acquired and integrated 23 complementary businesses, which have contributed significantly to our growth. We continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business, including acquisitions in the southeastern United States, as part of our ongoing growth strategy. We cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions. To successfully acquire a significant target, we may need to raise additional equity and/or incur additional indebtedness, which could increase our leverage level. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and complete acquisition transactions on favorable terms, or at all. The investigation of acquisition candidates and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments require substantial management time and attention and costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we fail to complete any acquisition for any reason, including events beyond our control, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed acquisition likely would not be recoverable.\nAcquisitions typically require integration of the acquired company\u2019s estimation, project management, finance, information technology, risk management, purchasing and fleet management functions. We may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired business into our existing business, and an acquired business may not be as profitable as we had expected or at all. Acquisitions involve risks that the acquired business will not perform as expected and that our expectations concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of the acquired business will prove incorrect. Our inability to successfully integrate new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs, reduce profits or generate losses and prevent us from realizing expected rates of return on an acquired business. Factors affecting the successful integration of an acquired business include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022our responsibility for certain liabilities of an acquired business, whether or not known to us, which could include, among other things, tax liabilities, product and other tort liabilities, breach of contract claims, environmental liabilities, permitting and regulatory compliance issues and liabilities for employment practices;\n\u2022our ability to retain local managers and key employees who are important to the operations of an acquired business;\n\u2022the attention required by our senior management and the management of an acquired business for integration efforts, which could decrease the time that they have to service and attract customers;\n\u2022our ability to effectively utilize new equipment that we acquire;\n\u2022the implementation of our financial and management information systems, business practices and policies;\n\u2022our pursuit of multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously; and\n\u2022unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.\nIn addition, potential acquisition targets may be in states in which we do not currently operate, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities and subject us to additional and unfamiliar legal requirements.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will achieve synergies and cost savings in connection with future acquisitions. Many of the businesses that we previously acquired, and businesses that we may acquire in the future, could have unaudited financial statements that are prepared by management and are not independently reviewed or audited, and such financial statements could be materially different if they were independently reviewed or audited. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to acquire businesses at valuations consistent with our prior acquisitions or that we will complete future acquisitions at all. We also cannot know whether there will be attractive acquisition opportunities at reasonable prices, that financing will be available or that we can successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. In addition, our results of operations from these acquisitions could, in the future, result in impairment charges for any of our intangible assets, including goodwill or other long-lived assets, particularly if economic conditions worsen unexpectedly.\nWe may lose business to competitors that underbid us and may be unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry.\nMost of our project awards are determined through a competitive bidding process in which price is the determining factor. Because of the high cost of transporting HMA, our ability to win a project award is often influenced by the distance between a work site and our HMA plants. We compete against multiple competitors in many of the markets in which we operate. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and are vertically integrated. As a result, our competitors may be able to bid at lower prices than we can due to the location of their plants or as a result of their size or vertical integration advantages. Government funding for public infrastructure projects is limited, contributing to competition for the limited number of public projects available. An increase in competition may result in a decrease in new project awards to us at acceptable profit margins. In addition, in the event of a downturn in private\nresidential and commercial construction, the competition for available public infrastructure projects could intensify, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain sufficient bonding capacity, which could preclude us from bidding on certain projects.\nA significant number of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. Sureties typically issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis, and they can decline to do so at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition thereto. Our ability to obtain performance and payment bonds primarily depends on our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise, reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult or costly to obtain in the future. If we are unable to obtain or renew a sufficient level of bonding, or if bonding costs were to increase, we may be precluded from bidding on certain projects or successfully contracting with certain customers, which could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with such bonds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal and subject to adverse weather conditions, which can adversely impact our business.\nOur construction operations occur outdoors in an area of the country in which hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms are common and snow frequently occurs in certain markets in the winter. As a result, seasonal changes and adverse weather conditions, such as extended snowy, rainy or cold weather, can adversely affect our business operations through a decline in the use and production of HMA, a decline in the demand for our construction services, alterations and delays in our construction schedules, and reduced efficiencies in our contracting operations, resulting in under-utilization of crews and equipment and lower contract profitability. Climate change may lead to increased extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, including natural disasters. Should the impact of climate change be significant or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our information technology systems and processes, which are subject to cybersecurity and data leakage risks.\nWe depend on information technology systems and infrastructure that could be damaged or interrupted by a variety of factors. Any significant breach, breakdown, destruction or interruption of these systems has the potential to negatively affect our operations. We could experience a business interruption, theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyber attack, such as the infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or through our third-party providers. Although we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Similarly, our suppliers rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage their businesses and, thus, are also at risk from, and may be impacted by, cybersecurity attacks. An interruption in the business operations of our suppliers and other third parties with which we do business resulting from a cybersecurity attack could indirectly impact our business operations.\nDesign-build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions.\nDesign-build contracts are used as a method of project delivery that provides the owner with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. We generally subcontract design responsibility to architectural and engineering firms. However, in the event of a design error or omission that causes damages, there is a risk that the subcontractor and/or its errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the full amount of the liability incurred. In this case, we may be responsible for the remaining liability, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we enter into joint venture contracts to perform certain projects, and these arrangements expose us to certain risks and uncertainties that are outside of our control.\nFrom time to time, we perform construction projects as part of a joint venture, under which our relationship to the other joint venture partners is governed by a written contract. Participation in these arrangements exposes us to risks and uncertainties, including the risk that our partners may fail to perform under the contracts, which could subject us to contractual liability. In addition, if our partners are not able or willing to provide their share of capital investment to fund the operations of the venture or the joint venture arrangement is terminated, there could be unanticipated costs to complete the project, or we could be liable for financial penalties or liquidated damages. In the event that we are not the controlling partner in the joint venture, we may have limited control over the decisions made with respect to the project. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur continued success requires us to hire, train and retain qualified personnel and subcontractors in a competitive industry.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified, reliable personnel, including, but not limited to, our executive officers and key management personnel. In addition, we rely on engineers, project management personnel, and other employees and qualified subcontractors who possess the necessary and required experience and expertise to perform their respective services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense, and it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the requisite expertise and within the time frame demanded by our customers. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire, train and retain qualified personnel. Also, it could be difficult to replace personnel who hold credentials that may be required to perform certain government projects and/or who have significant government contract experience.\nAs some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age, we must provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to identify and integrate new personnel into vacant leadership roles and other key positions. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects and our strategic plan may be adversely affected, the costs of executing both our existing and future projects may increase, and our financial performance may decline.\nIn addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with immigration laws could result in significant liabilities, harm our reputation with our customers and disrupt our operations.\nAlthough we take steps to verify the employment eligibility status of all our employees, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and, if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse publicity that could make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration laws. If we fail to comply with these laws, our operations may be disrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with immigration laws, and, in some cases, our customers audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure that our subcontractors comply with these laws with respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws or to ensure compliance by our subcontractors could damage our reputation and may cause our customers to cancel contracts with us or to not award future business to us. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe depend on third parties for equipment and supplies essential to operate our business.\nWe rely on third parties to sell or lease real property, plants and equipment to us and to provide us with supplies, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction materials necessary for our operations. The inability to purchase or lease the properties, plants or equipment that are necessary for our operations could severely impact our business. If we lose our supply contracts and receive insufficient supplies from third parties to meet our customers\u2019 needs, or if our suppliers experience price increases or disruptions to their business, such as labor disputes, supply shortages, financial or regulatory difficulties or distribution problems, our ability to bid for or complete contracts could be impaired, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe consume natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential reliability issues, supply constraints and significant price fluctuations.\nIn our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control, such as unavailability due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum-based products, and other factors. Furthermore, we are vulnerable to any reliability issues experienced by our suppliers, which also are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources, and our sources of supply could be interrupted if our suppliers are unable to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability. Additionally, increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products utilized in our operations, particularly increases following a bid based on lower costs for such products, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur contract backlog is subject to reductions in scope and cancellations and therefore could be an unreliable indicator of our future earnings.\nAt September 30, 2020, our contract backlog was $608.1 million, compared to $531.6 million at September 30, 2019. Our contract backlog generally consists of construction projects for which we either have an executed contract or commitment with a client or have submitted the current low bid. Contract backlog does not include external sales of HMA, aggregates, and liquid asphalt cement. Moreover, our contract backlog reflects our expected revenues from the contract, commitment or bid, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in our contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may adversely affect the revenues and profit we ultimately realize on these projects.\nFailure of our subcontractors to perform as expected could have a negative impact on our results.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts, but we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work. Although we often require bonding or other forms of guarantees from our subcontractors, we are not always able to obtain such bonds or guarantees. In situations where we are unable to obtain a bond or guarantee, we may be responsible for the failures on the part of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated. In addition, if the total costs of a project exceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project.\nThe construction services industry is highly schedule-driven, and our failure to meet the schedule requirements of our contracts could adversely affect our reputation and/or expose us to financial liability.\nIn some instances, including in the case of many of our fixed unit price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date. Any failure to meet the contractual schedule or satisfy the completion requirements set forth in our contracts could subject us to responsibility for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages, liability for our customer\u2019s actual costs arising out of our delay, reduced profits or a loss on that project, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAn inability to secure sufficient aggregate reserves could have a negative impact on our future results of operations.\nStrict governmental regulations and the limited number of properties containing useful aggregate reserves have made it increasingly challenging and costly to obtain sufficient aggregates to support our business, both with respect to internal use and third-party sales. If we are unable to obtain adequate reserves to support our business, then our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nForce majeure events, such as natural disasters, pandemics and terrorist attacks, and unexpected equipment failures could negatively impact our business, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nForce majeure events, such as terrorist attacks, pandemics or natural disasters, have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the United States economy and the markets in which we operate. As an example, from time to time, we face unexpected severe weather conditions, evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services, increased labor and material costs or shortages, inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to work sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. We seek to include language in our contracts with private customers that grants us certain relief in connection with force majeure events, and we attempt to mitigate the potential impact arising from force majeure events in both public and private customer contracts. However, the extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our customers, and we remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events, subject to any relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause. Additionally, our manufacturing processes depend on critical pieces of equipment, such as our HMA plants. This equipment, on occasion, may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damage. Any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage and cause us to lose revenues due to lost production time. These force majeure events may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, production capability and ability to complete contracts in a timely manner.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by a widespread outbreak of a contagious disease or other similar adverse public health development, such as COVID-19, or fear of such an event, and the measures that federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and health authorities implement to address it.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by the effects of a widespread outbreak of a contagious disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar adverse public health development, as well as actions taken by federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and health authorities to contain the outbreak. Such an event in our markets could, among other things, result in employee absences or require us to temporarily close our facilities or project sites, which, in turn, could significantly and adversely affect our productivity and our ability to complete projects in accordance with our contractual obligations. In addition, a disruption in the supply chain for raw materials or equipment, whether as a result of facility closures or otherwise, could increase our labor and\nmaterials costs and impair our ability to manufacture HMA. Moreover, our customers - both public and private - who are adversely impacted could cancel or delay current or prospective projects and could become delinquent in their payments to us for work that we have performed. Although several of these risks have materialized in varying degrees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, none of these risks, individually or in the aggregate, have significantly impacted our operations to date.\nOur business could also be negatively impacted over the medium-to-longer term if the disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic decrease consumer confidence generally or significantly prolong the current economic downturn, which could lead to a decline in public and private development projects and thereby reduce demand for our services. An economic slowdown caused by the outbreak of an infectious disease or other similar adverse public health development could cause, and in some cases have caused, the tax revenues received by federal, state and local government agencies to decline and thereby decrease the funding available for public projects. Such developments could (i) impair our ability to undertake construction projects in a typical manner or at all, generate revenues and cash flows, and/or access the capital or lending markets (or significantly increase the costs of doing so); (ii) increase the costs or decrease the supply of raw materials or equipment or the availability of subcontractors and other talent, including as a result of infections or quarantining; and/or (iii) result in the diversion of public funds that otherwise would be available for infrastructure projects to support public health efforts. The inherent uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, due in part to rapidly changing governmental directives, public health challenges and progress, and market reactions thereto, also makes it challenging for our management to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the future performance of our business.\nA failure to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy and pursuant to requirements contained in our financing agreements and in a majority of our contracts to maintain specific types and amounts of coverage. Although we have been able to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, and increased premium costs or deductibles. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage, we would be subject to increased out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim and we may not be able to procure certain contracts, either of which could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nWe could incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications.\nWe provide our customers with products designed to comply with building codes or other regulatory requirements, as well as any applicable contractual specifications, including, but not limited to, with respect to durability, compressive strength and weight-bearing capacity. If our products do not satisfy these requirements and specifications, material claims may arise against us, our reputation could be damaged and, if any such claims are for an uninsured, non-indemnified or product-related matter, then resolution of such claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe are, and may continue to be, involved in routine litigation and government inquiries in the ordinary course of business.\nDue to the nature of our business, we are involved in routine litigation or subject to other disputes or claims related to our business activities, including, among other things, workers\u2019 compensation claims, employment-related disputes and issues related to liability, breach of contract or tortious conduct in connection with our performance of services and provision of materials. We are also subject to government inquiries in the ordinary course of business seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty. The outcomes of these inquiries and legal proceedings are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations on an individual basis, although adverse outcomes in a significant number of such ordinary course inquiries and legal proceedings could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and any changes to, or liabilities arising under, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection and public health and safety. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including requirements to obtain a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; limitations on activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; and assessments of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. For example, a number of governmental bodies have finalized, proposed or are contemplating legislative and regulatory actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, such as monitoring, reporting and emissions control requirements for certain large sources of greenhouse gases and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Because we emit greenhouse gases through the manufacture of HMA products and through the combustion of fossil fuels as part of our mining and road\nconstruction services, any such laws and regulations applicable to jurisdictions in which we operate could require us to incur costs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with our operations.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or third-party facilities that receive waste generated by our operations, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from our own actions or those of others and whether such actions complied with applicable laws at the time they were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could assume, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. Furthermore, the existence of contamination at properties that we own, lease or operate could result in increased operational costs or restrictions on our ability to use those properties as intended, including for mining purposes.\nNumerous government authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Certain environmental laws impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of \u201cfault\u201d is required) or joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, compensatory damages, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nIn certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to receive environmental permits that we need to operate. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to our industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and, consequently, affecting profitability.\nOur operations are subject to special hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses that may not be covered by insurance.\nOperating hazards inherent in our business, some of which may be outside of our control, can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, and environmental damage. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against risks that we believe are consistent with industry practice, but this insurance may be inadequate or unavailable to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations. Our insurance policies are subject to varying levels of deductibles. Losses up to our deductible amounts are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. However, liabilities subject to insurance are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of unreported incidents and the effectiveness of our safety programs. If we experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we may be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than for maintaining or expanding our operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nOur debt consists primarily of our borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which, as of September 30, 2020, provided for a $96.1 million Term Loan and a $50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. A significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Among other consequences, this level of indebtedness could:\n\u2022require us to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the satisfaction of repayment obligations, and not for other purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow money or issue equity to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements;\n\u2022cause our interest expense to increase if there is a general increase in interest rates, because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and future business opportunities;\n\u2022cause us to be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy; and\n\u2022limit our ability to exploit business opportunities.\nAlthough the Credit Agreement restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. This could reduce our ability to satisfy our current obligations and further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nThe Credit Agreement restricts our ability to engage in some business and financial transactions.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, create liens on assets, change our or our subsidiaries\u2019 fiscal year, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into certain restrictive agreements, engage in mergers or consolidations, participate in partnerships and joint ventures, sell assets, incur additional liens, pay dividends or distributions and make other restricted payments, make investments, loans or advances, repay or amend the terms of subordinated indebtedness, make acquisitions, enter into certain operating leases, enter into certain hedge transactions, amend material contracts, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nThe Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio and contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreement will be entitled to accelerate amounts due thereunder and take other actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nThe previously announced phase-out of LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect the interest rate that we pay on our indebtedness.\nThe annual interest rates applicable to advances made under the Credit Agreement is calculated, at our option, by using either a base rate or LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage that corresponds to our consolidated total leverage ratio. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates, including the rates we pay on borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and result in higher borrowing costs. The Credit Agreement provides that, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events relating to the end of LIBOR, we and the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement will select a different benchmark rate to replace LIBOR as the reference rate for interest accruing on certain advances. Changes in, or the inability to agree on, an alternative rate or benchmark may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which could impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.\nOur ongoing ability to generate cash is important for funding our continuing operations, making acquisitions and servicing our indebtedness. To the extent that existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part on prevailing market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results. Furthermore, if global economic, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to draw upon our Revolving Credit Facility may be impacted. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make certain investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified \u201cdisadvantaged business enterprises\u201d to perform as subcontractors, which could cause us to breach certain contracts with governmental customers.\nSome of our contracts with governmental agencies contain minimum \u201cdisadvantaged business enterprise\u201d (\u201cDBE\u201d) participation clauses, which require us to maintain a requisite level of DBE participation. If we fail to obtain or maintain the required level of DBE participation, we could be held responsible for breach of contract. Such a breach could impair our ability to bid on future projects and could require us to pay monetary damages. To the extent that we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses, which could materially affect our business and reputation.\nBecause our employees and others are often in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical substances and dangerous manufacturing processes, our construction and maintenance sites are potentially dangerous workplaces. Therefore, safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. We are often responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. In addition, many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also can increase employee turnover, which increases project costs and therefore our overall operating costs. If we fail to implement effective safety procedures, our employees could be injured, the completion of a project could be delayed, or we could be exposed to investigations and possible litigation. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards through our safety programs could also result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients.\nWe may be required to record an impairment charge if we determine that goodwill recorded in connection with prior acquisitions has become impaired, and this determination requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the future that are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.\nAt September 30, 2020 and 2019, we had $46.3 million and $38.5 million, respectively, of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually or more often if required. Our assessments involve a number of estimates and assumptions that are inherently subjective and require significant judgment regarding highly uncertain matters that are subject to change. The use of different assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination as to whether or not an impairment has occurred. In addition, if future events are less favorable than what we assumed or estimated in our impairment analysis, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management. Our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting standards that we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require us to make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters, including with respect to revenue recognition, contracts receivable including retainage, valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, accrued insurance costs and share-based payments and other equity transactions. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require us to make subjective and complex judgments. Although we believe we have the experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues and profit. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different methods to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. For more information about our critical accounting policies and use of estimates, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with SunTx Capital Partners (\u201cSunTx\u201d) and its affiliates, which limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 9, 2020, our outstanding Class B common stock represented approximately 84.1% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. The shares of Class B common stock are held primarily by SunTx, its affiliates and certain members of management. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and our Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders. This concentrated control limits or precludes the ability of holders of Class A common stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. Future transfers of shares of our Class B common stock generally may result in those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock. The conversion of shares of our Class B common stock into our Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of each remaining share of Class B common stock.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs as a result of being a public company, which may significantly affect our financial condition.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses associated with our financial reporting and corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and rules implemented by the SEC. For example, as a publicly traded company, we are required to adopt policies\nregarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, including the preparation of reports on internal control over financial reporting. These rules and regulations have made, and may continue to make, it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nFor so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), we have taken, and intend to continue to take, advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict whether investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, and our Class A common stock price may be more volatile. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total revenues equals or exceeds $1.07 billion, (ii) September 30, 2023, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Exchange Act. In addition, after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies, including certain requirements of Section 404 that currently do not apply to us.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and our Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have designed and implemented a number of internal controls and other remedial measures that we believe will provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. A failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial information or cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline and impact our liquidity, perceived creditworthiness and ability to complete acquisitions. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, under the JOBS Act, will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs related to certain requirements of Section 404. If we are unable to timely comply with such requirements, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404, which requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls when we cease to qualify for an exemption from the requirement to provide auditors\u2019 attestation on internal controls afforded to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act. The out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 have been significant, and we expect to continue to incur substantial costs in connection with our compliance efforts. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our auditors identify and report any material weaknesses, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, subject us to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of Class A common stock by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.\nAs of December 9, 2020, we had outstanding a total of 33,875,884 shares of our Class A common stock and 17,905,861 shares of our Class B common stock that are convertible at any time into an equal number of shares of our Class A common stock. The sale of shares of our Class A common stock, or the perception of future sales by us or our existing stockholders, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nWe have filed a \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) with respect to the issuance of up to $250 million in aggregate amount of various securities (including Class A common stock) by us and the sale of up to 19,225,000 shares of Class A common stock by SunTx. As of December 9, 2020, we had not issued any securities under the registration statement, and 5,511,074 shares of Class A common stock remained available for future sale by SunTx under the registration statement. In addition, shares held by our affiliates, including our directors, executive officers and SunTx, may also be sold in compliance with various exemptions from registration.\nPursuant to a registration rights agreement, SunTx and certain other stockholders will continue to have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares, these stockholders could cause the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock to decline. As of December 9, 2020, a total of 17,387,734 shares of our outstanding common stock were subject to potential future registration under the registration rights agreement. Registration of these shares would result in such shares becoming freely tradable upon effectiveness of the registration statement. As restrictions on resale end or if the stockholders who are party to the registration rights agreement exercise their registration rights, the market price of the shares of our Class A common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our Class A common stock or other securities.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with offerings or acquisitions, and the number of shares issued or issuable thereafter could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Any such issuance would result in dilution to holders of our Class A common stock.\nAffiliates of SunTx control us, and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nAs of December 9, 2020, the SunTx funds beneficially owned approximately 16.3% of our Class A common stock and approximately 88.3% of our Class B common stock, representing 76.9% of the combined voting power of our common stock. Each share of our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and each share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a result, affiliates of SunTx have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our Class A common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our Class A common stock, our ability to incur or issue debt, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and our entry into extraordinary transactions. This concentration of voting control could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of our Class A common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in related party transactions involving SunTx and certain companies they control. As a result, the interests of affiliates of SunTx may not in all cases be aligned with your interests.\nIn addition, SunTx may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, SunTx could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets. SunTx is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of SunTx, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. SunTx also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nSo long as SunTx and its affiliates continue to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, they will continue to be able to effectively control our decisions, even if the number of shares of outstanding Class B common stock is limited in proportion to the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. For example, assuming our Class B common stock amounted to 15% of our total outstanding common stock, we would have 44,014,484 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 7,767,261 shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of December 9, 2020. These outstanding shares of Class B common stock would collectively represent approximately 63.8% of the overall voting power of our common stock. Shares of our Class B common stock may be transferred to an unrelated third party if holders of a majority of the shares of our Class B common stock owned by SunTx and its affiliates consent to such transfer in writing in advance.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or upon the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our governing documents and Delaware corporate law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our Company, which could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our Company difficult, including:\n\u2022a dual class common stock structure, which currently provides SunTx and its affiliates and the other holders of our Class B common stock with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, so long as they continue to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, even if they own significantly less than 50% of the total number of shares of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors or amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022the authority of our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay for shares of our Class A common stock.\nOur governing documents designate certain courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, state courts within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any: (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or (iv) action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and that if any action specified above is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (each is referred to herein as a foreign action), the claiming party will be deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the exclusive forum provision described above and (b) having service of process made upon such claiming party by service upon such claiming party\u2019s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such claiming party. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions inapplicable to, or\nunenforceable in respect of, one or more covered proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nBecause we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the rules of the SEC, our stockholders do not have, and may never have, certain corporate governance protections that are available to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.\nSunTx and its affiliates control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and SEC rules. As a result, we are not required to comply with certain provisions requiring that (i) a majority of our directors be independent, (ii) the compensation of our executives be determined by independent directors or (iii) nominees for election to our board of directors be selected by independent directors. Because we intend to continue to take advantage of some or all of these exemptions, our stockholders may not have the protections that these rules are intended to provide. Our status as a controlled company could cause our Class A common stock to be less attractive to certain investors or otherwise reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation, if any, of the price of our Class A common stock will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, the Credit Agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.\nItem 1B.",

In January 2017, the Company paid a cash\ndividend to its stockholders. The seller alleges that he was entitled to receive approximately $1.5 million in dividends with respect to shares for which the stock certificates were still in escrow at the time the dividend was paid. The seller also has claimed an unspecified amount of damages arising out of his allegation that the Company provided insufficient information to him prior to the transaction regarding the status and timing of the Company\u2019s initial public offering in May 2018.

Historical results may not be indicative of future performance. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the headings \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d This discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. In this discussion, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures. An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.\nOverview\nWe are a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the building and maintenance of transportation networks. Our operations leverage a highly-skilled workforce, strategically located HMA plants, substantial construction assets and select material deposits. We provide construction products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential sites in the southeastern United States.\nOur public projects are funded by federal, state and local governments and include roads, highways, bridges, airports and other forms of infrastructure. Public transportation infrastructure projects historically have been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets and represent a significant share of the United States construction market. Federal funds are allocated on a state-by-state basis, and each state is required to match a portion of the federal funds that it receives. Federal highway spending uses funds predominantly from the Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenues from fuel taxes and other user fees.\nIn addition to public infrastructure projects, we provide a wide range of large site work construction and HMA paving services to private construction customers, including commercial and residential developers and local businesses.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including its impact on our customers, employees, suppliers, and vendors. We did not incur significant disruptions from COVID-19 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as road construction has been designated a \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d industry and an \u201cessential business\u201d in each state within our footprint, which has allowed us to continue to operate without significant delays related to state and local shelter-in-place orders. In fact, in certain states in which we operate, including Florida and Alabama, some public projects were accelerated in order to leverage construction efficiencies driven by lower vehicle traffic during the shelter-in-place orders resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, due to the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position, operating results and cash flows in future periods. We continue to monitor risks to our business arising from increasing transmission rates of COVID-19, including (i) our need to adopt enhanced safety and cleaning protocols, which have required significant time and attention from our management and workforce, (ii) employee absences, which could adversely affect our productivity and our ability to complete projects in accordance with our contractual obligations, and could require us to temporarily close our facilities or project sites, (iii) potential disruptions in our supply chains for raw materials or equipment, whether as a result of facility closures or otherwise, which could increase our labor and materials costs and impair our ability to manufacture hot-mix asphalt, and (iv) the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, which could cause these customers to cancel or delay current or prospective projects or become delinquent in their payments to us for work that we have performed. Several of these risks have materialized in varying degrees, but none of these risks, individually or in the aggregate, have significantly impacted our operations to date.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on fuel and sales tax revenues, which in turn drive funding levels for public projects in our markets. For instance, a substantial portion of our revenues each quarter are derived from projects completed for various Departments of Transportation, including the Alabama Department of Transportation (\u201cALDOT\u201d) and the North Carolina Department of Transportation (\u201cNCDOT\u201d), each of which has accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for various periods within the past two fiscal years, as further described under the heading \u201cConcentration of Risks\u201d in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. In North Carolina, the NCDOT has implemented several measures in recent months to address preexisting funding pressures that were exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including suspending preliminary engineering work on potential future projects, delaying commencement of certain pending projects and reducing the number and size of projects available for bid, which resulted in decreased revenue during the last quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. However, recent legislative efforts and increased fuel tax receipts have facilitated the generation of cash reserves in excess of the statutory minimum (a prerequisite for future project lettings) and approvals for future bond issuances that will be used for funding projects in subsequent periods. Management believes that this market remains poised for future growth in light of its favorable population trends and adequate structural long-term funding mechanisms. In Alabama, the decline in gas tax revenue receipts related to reductions in fuel purchased by motorists in recent months has been largely offset by an increase in the fuel tax that became effective in late 2019.\nThe extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact. Furthermore, the impacts of a potential worsening of economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the financial markets remain unknown.\nHow We Assess Performance of Our Business\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues predominantly by providing construction products and services for both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential sites. Our projects represent a mix of federal, state, municipal and private customers. We also derive revenues from the sale of HMA, aggregates, and liquid asphalt cement to customers. Revenues derived from projects are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost input method). Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to estimated costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Revenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates, and liquid asphalt cement are recognized when the risks associated with ownership have passed to the customer.\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues consists of all direct and indirect costs associated with construction contracts, including raw materials, labor, equipment costs, depreciation, lease expenses, subcontract costs and other expenses at our HMA plants, aggregate mining facilities, and liquid asphalt cement terminal. Our cost of revenues is directly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, primarily liquid asphalt and diesel fuel. From time to time, when appropriate, we limit our exposure to changes in commodity prices by entering into forward purchase commitments. In addition, our public infrastructure contracts often provide for price adjustments based on fluctuations in certain commodity-related product costs. These price adjustment provisions are in place for most of our public infrastructure contracts, and we seek to include similar provisions in our private contracts.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired as a business combination, at fair value. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense is the periodic expense related to leasehold improvements and intangible assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the underlying asset or the remaining lease term. Our intangible assets were recognized as a result of certain acquisitions and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Quarry reserves are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregate is extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs related to our operational offices that are not allocated to direct contract costs and expenses related to our corporate offices. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs for our administration, finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and certain managerial employees. General and administrative expenses also include acquisition expenses, audit, consulting and professional fees, stock-based compensation expense, travel, insurance, office space rental costs, property taxes and other corporate and overhead expenses.\nGain on Sale of Equipment, Net\nIn the normal course of business, we sell construction equipment for various reasons, including when the cost of maintaining the asset exceeds the cost of replacing it. The gain or loss on the sale of equipment reflects the difference between the carrying value at the date of disposal and the net consideration received from the sale of equipment during the period.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net primarily represents interest incurred on our long-term debt, such as the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, as well as the changes in fair values of interest swap agreements and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. These amounts are partially offset by interest income earned on short-term investments of cash balances in excess of our current operating needs.\nOther Key Performance Indicators - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before, as applicable from time to time, (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion and amortization of long-lived assets, (iv) equity-based compensation expense, (v) loss on the extinguishment of debt and (vi) certain management fees and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues for each period. These metrics are supplemental measures of our operating performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because management uses these measures as key performance indicators, and we believe that securities analysts, investors and others use these measures to evaluate companies in our industry. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies. Potential differences may include differences in capital structures, tax positions and the age and book depreciation of intangible and tangible assets.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\n(1)Reflects fees and reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses under a management services agreement with SunTx Capital Partners, the Company's controlling stockholder (see Note 17 - Related Parties to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report).\nResults of Operations - Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2019\nThe following table sets forth selected financial data for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 (\u201cfiscal 2020\u201d) and September 30, 2019 (\u201cfiscal 2019\u201d) (in thousands, except percentages):\nRevenues. Revenues for fiscal 2020 increased $2.5 million, or 0.3%, to $785.7 million from $783.2 million for fiscal 2019. Revenues in markets we served on September 30, 2019 decreased by $47.1 million during fiscal 2020, primarily due to a reduction in the number of projects available for bid in certain of our markets, including North Carolina, and our resulting efforts to manage our backlog and effectively utilize our workforce in light of the uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was offset by a $49.6 million increase in total revenue attributable to acquisitions that we completed during or subsequent to fiscal 2019.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2020 increased $4.2 million, or 3.6%, to $122.2 million from $118.0 million for fiscal 2019. The higher gross profit was the result of an increase in gross profit margin to 15.6% for fiscal 2020 from 15.1% for fiscal 2019, primarily due to efficient utilization of our plants and equipment, and the contribution from the liquid asphalt terminal, which we acquired during fiscal 2019 and allows us to purchase liquid asphalt at wholesale prices, thereby reducing our cost of revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $5.9 million, or 9.4%, to $68.6 million from $62.7 million for fiscal 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of (i) a $2.9 million increase in overhead expenses attributable to acquisitions that we completed during or subsequent to fiscal 2019, (ii) a $3.1 million increase in management personnel payroll and benefits and (iii) a $0.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other general administrative expenses of $0.7 million.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2020 increased $1.2 million, or 67.3%, to $3.1 million compared to $1.9 million for fiscal 2019. The increase in interest expense, net reflects a $0.3 million increase in interest expense and a decrease of $0.9 million in interest income. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the average principal debt balance outstanding for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 and a $1.4 million charge to interest expense related to a change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps during fiscal 2020, compared to a $0.6 million charge during fiscal 2019. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in the interest rate on our debt compared to fiscal year 2019. The decrease in interest income was due to a decrease in interest rates earned on our deposits.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased to 24.0% for fiscal 2020, from 24.4% for fiscal 2019. Our lower effective tax rate was the result of filing an amended consolidated state return, as a result of which the Company recorded an amended return benefit of $0.4 million related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and a corresponding release of a valuation allowance.\nEarnings from Investment in Joint Venture. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we earned $0.6 million and $1.3 million of pre-tax income, respectively, from our 50% interest in the earnings of a joint venture that we entered into with a third party in November 2017 for the sole purpose of performing a construction project for ALDOT.\nNet Income. Net income decreased $2.8 million, or 6.5%, to $40.3 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $43.1 million for fiscal 2019. This decrease in net income was primarily a result of higher general and administrative expenses and additional interest expense during fiscal 2020, and was substantially offset by higher gross profit. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $5.9 million, or 9.4%, to $68.6 million from $62.7 million for fiscal 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were $98.4 million and 12.5%, respectively, for fiscal 2020, compared to $92.3 million and 11.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2019. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA primarily resulted from the increase in gross profit, depreciation, depletion and amortization of long-lived assets for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense and interest expense, net. The increase in the Adjusted EBITDA Margin was primarily the result of increased depreciation, depletion and amortization of long-lived assets. For a description of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as well as a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \u201cHow We Assess Performance of Our Business.\u201d\nInflation and Price Changes\nInflation had an immaterial impact on our results of operations for fiscal 2020 and 2019 due to relatively low inflation in the United States and our ability to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher prices for our products, including through the use of sale price escalator clauses in most of our public sector infrastructure contracts. Inflation risk varies with the level of activity in our industry, the number, size and strength of competitors and the availability of products to supply a local market.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows Analysis\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nOperating Activities\nDuring fiscal 2020, cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions, was $105.2 million, primarily as a result of:\n\u2022net income of $40.3 million, including $39.3 million of depreciation, depletion and amortization of long-lived assets;\n\u2022a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8.1 million, primarily reflecting the $7.7 million payment received by certain of our subsidiaries from January 2020 to July 2020 in connection with a settlement agreement we entered into in April 2018; and\n\u2022a decrease in contracts receivable including retainage, net of $7.4 million due to a reduction in fiscal year 2020 fourth quarter job activity in certain of our markets, including North Carolina, compared to the prior year.\nDuring fiscal 2019, cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions, was $55.3 million primarily as a result of:\n\u2022net income of $43.1 million, including $31.2 million of depreciation, depletion and amortization of long-lived assets;\n\u2022contracts receivable including retainage, net increasing by $20.6 million as a result of higher overall revenues; and\n\u2022inventory increasing by $8.8 million, of which $6.5 million related to our acquisition and operation of the liquid asphalt terminal and other acquisitions during fiscal 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring fiscal 2020, cash used in investing activities was $79.4 million, of which $30.2 million related to acquisitions completed in the period and $52.6 million of which was invested in property, plant and equipment, which included $11.5 million for the buyout of equipment leases, and was partially offset by $3.0 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment.\nDuring fiscal 2019, cash used in investing activities was $60.2 million, $24.7 million of which related to acquisitions completed in the period and $42.5 million of which was invested in property, plant and equipment, which was partially offset by $4.5 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $41.9 million. We received $72.3 million from proceeds on long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs and discounts, which was offset by $30.4 million of principal payments on long-term debt.\nDuring fiscal 2019, cash used in financing activities was $13.6 million, primarily due to principal payments on long-term debt of $13.0 million during the period.\nCredit Agreement\nWe and each of our subsidiaries are parties to the Credit Agreement, which provides for the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, we had $92.9 million and $44.7 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Term Loan, $0.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and availability of $39.3 million and $14.4 million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility, including reduction for outstanding letters of credit. The obligations of our subsidiaries under the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets.\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20-to-1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 2.75-to-1.00, subject to certain adjustments. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.85-to-1.00 and 4.04-to-1.00, respectively, and our consolidated leverage ratio was 1.08-to-1.00 and 0.66-to-1.00, respectively.\nFrom time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of changes in interest rates. These interest rate swap agreements do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with GAAP. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate notional value of these interest rate swap agreements was $46.5 million and $21.5 million, respectively, and the fair value was $(1.7) million and $(0.3) million, respectively, which is included within other liabilities or other assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor more information about the Credit Amendment, see Note 11 - Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nDuring fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our capital expenditures were approximately $52.6 million and $42.5 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures are typically made during the same fiscal year in which they are approved. At September 30, 2020, our commitments for capital expenditures were not material to our financial condition or results of operations on a consolidated basis. For fiscal 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be $47.0 million to $50.0 million. Our capital expenditure budget is an estimate and is subject to change.\nHistorically, we have required significant amounts of cash in order to make capital expenditures, purchase materials and fund our organic expansion into new markets. Our working capital needs are driven by the seasonality and growth of our business, with our cash requirements increasing in periods of growth. Additional cash requirements resulting from our growth include the costs of additional personnel, production and distribution facilities, enhancements to our information systems, integration costs related to any acquisitions and our compliance with laws and rules applicable to public companies.\nWe have historically relied on cash available through credit facilities, in addition to cash from operations, to finance our working capital requirements and to support our growth. We regularly monitor potential capital sources, including equity and debt markets, in an effort to meet our planned capital expenditures and liquidity requirements. Our future success will depend on our ability to access outside sources of capital.\nWe believe that our operating cash flow and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations through September 30, 2021. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the potential impacts of COVID-19, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to conduct our operations. There can be no assurance that\noperations and other capital resources will provide sufficient cash to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. In the event that we make one or more acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount of cash on hand we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we seek additional capital, we may do so through borrowings under the Credit Agreement, joint ventures, asset sales, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. However, the unprecedented public health and governmental efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have created significant uncertainty as to general economic conditions for fiscal year 2021 and beyond, and our ability to engage in any such transactions may be constrained by economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. We cannot guarantee that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain the funds we need, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to conduct our operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2020, the Company had aggregate letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $10.9 million and future purchase commitments of $1.3 million for diesel fuel. Other than the letters of credit and future purchase commitments described therein, we do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical accounting policies are those policies that, in management\u2019s view, are the most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. The notes to the consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Those critical accounting policies and estimates that require the most significant judgment are discussed further below.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). Our private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Revenues from fixed unit price and fixed total price construction contracts are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost input method). Under this method, revenues are recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs. This cost-to-cost method is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as equipment costs, insurance and employee benefits. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenues and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nChange orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract without adding new provisions or terms. Change orders may include changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work. Either we or our customers may initiate change orders. We consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which we have a change of scope for which we believe we are contractually entitled to a higher price, but where a price change associated with the scope change has not yet been agreed upon with the customer. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs as incurred. We recognize revenues equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is\nprobable. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers. Change orders that are unapproved as to both price and scope are evaluated as claims. We consider claims to be amounts in excess of agreed contract prices that we seek to collect from our customers or others for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes of unanticipated additional contract costs. Claims are included in the calculation of revenues when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. To support these requirements, the existence of the following items must be satisfied: (i) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim or a legal opinion has been obtained, stating that, under the circumstances, there is a reasonable basis to support the claim; (ii) additional costs are caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance; (iii) costs associated with the claim are identifiable or otherwise determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed; and (iv) the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable, not based on management\u2019s subjective evaluation of the situation or on unsupported representations. Revenues in excess of contract costs incurred on claims are recognized when an agreement is reached with the customer as to the value of the claim, which, in some instances, may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred.\nFor the majority of our contracts, upon completion and final acceptance of the services that we were contracted to perform, we receive our final payment upon completion of the necessary contract closing documents, and our obligations to the owner are complete at that point. The accuracy of our revenues and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the revenues and costs to finish uncompleted contracts. Our estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed \u201cbottom up\u201d approach. However, our projects can be highly complex and, in almost every case, the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid. Because we have a large number of projects of varying levels of size and complexity in process at any given time, these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability. However, large changes in revenues or cost estimates can have a significant effect on profitability.\nThe accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. Cost estimates for all of our projects use a detailed approach, and we believe our experience allows us to create materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include:\n\u2022the completeness and accuracy of the original bid;\n\u2022costs associated with scope changes;\n\u2022changes in costs of labor and/or materials;\n\u2022extended overhead and other costs due to owner, weather and other delays;\n\u2022subcontractor performance issues;\n\u2022changes in productivity expectations;\n\u2022site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;\n\u2022changes from original design on design-build projects;\n\u2022the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project;\n\u2022a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials;\n\u2022our ability to fully and promptly recover on affirmative claims and back charges for additional contract costs; and\n\u2022the customer\u2019s ability to properly administer the contract.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins, may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods, and these fluctuations may be significant.\nContracts Receivable, Including Retainage\nContracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed to the customer and currently due in accordance with our contracts. Many of the contracts under which we perform work contain retainage provisions. Retainage refers to amounts that we have billed to the customer, but are being held for payment by the customer pending satisfactory completion of the project. Retainage on active contracts is classified as a current asset regardless of the term of the contract and is generally collected within one year of the completion of a contract. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, contracts receivable included $21.0 million and $19.8 million, respectively, of retainage, which was being contractually withheld by customers until completion of the associated contracts.\nBecause the majority of our construction contracts are entered into with federal, state or municipal government customers, credit risk is minimal. We confirm that funds have been appropriated by the government project owner prior to commencing work on such projects. While most of our public contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government entity, in the event of any such termination, we are entitled to receive the contract price for completed work and reimbursement of termination-related costs. Credit risk with private owners is minimized because of statutory mechanic\u2019s liens, which give us high priority in the event of lien foreclosures following financial difficulties of private owners. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, which has historically been sufficient to cover accounts that are not collected.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nLong-lived assets, which include property, equipment and acquired intangible assets, such as goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment evaluations involve fair values and management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management, and this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate a material impairment of our long-lived assets.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. We performed our most recent annual impairment test on July 1, 2020. Our test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We first evaluate our market capitalization compared to the net assets of the Company overall. Our final determination of valuation is impacted by a number of factors, but the key factors are the price of our common stock, recently completed transactions from both public companies and private transactions and our estimated forecast of future cash flows.\nThe valuation approaches contain uncertainty regarding the estimates used. Our market capitalization could be impacted because we are a controlled company, which impacts the control premium we apply to the market price of our common stock. One of the largest uncertainties relates to federal, state and local government spending, which management expects to increase in the upcoming years. There are a number of other uncertainties with respect to our future financial performance that could impact estimated future cash flows, including those discussed under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this report. Based on our valuation approaches, we determined that our one reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired at July 1, 2020 or 2019. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, we had goodwill with a carrying amount of $46.3 million and $38.5 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and, where necessary, establish a valuation allowance. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nTo assess this likelihood, we use historical three-year results of operations, estimates and judgments regarding our future taxable income and consider the jurisdiction in which the taxable income is generated to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include our current financial position, results of operations, actual and forecasted results, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and the current and forecasted business economics of our industry. Additionally, we record uncertain tax positions at their net recognizable amount, based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOn the basis of our evaluations, at September 30, 2020 and 2019, no valuation allowance was recorded on our net deferred tax assets, and we had no material uncertain tax positions. If our estimates or assumptions regarding our current and deferred tax items are inaccurate or are modified, these changes could have potentially material impacts on our earnings.\nAccrued Insurance Cost\nWe carry insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily general liability, automobile liability and workers\u2019 compensation, under which we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid, ranging from $100,000 to $500,000 per occurrence. We accrue for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historic trends and modified, if necessary, by recent events. Changes in our loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would affect our assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect on our operating results and financial position up to $500,000 per occurrence for general liability, automobile liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims.\nWe provide employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the insurance company. Under the self-insured policies, we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. We purchase separate stop-loss insurance, which limits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $100,000 to $160,000.\nShare-Based Payments and Other Equity Transactions\nOur equity incentive plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. We account for our equity-based compensation plans using a fair value-based method of accounting, whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is typically the vesting period.\nOther Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Accounting Standards, to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, which are contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report and are incorporated by reference herein.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe JOBS Act permits an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have irrevocably elected to \u201copt out\u201d of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted.\nSeasonality\nThe activity of our business fluctuates due to seasonality because our business is primarily conducted outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended snowy, rainy or cold weather in the winter, spring or fall and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and the demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during our third and fourth fiscal quarters typically result in higher activity and revenues during those quarters. Our first and second fiscal quarters typically have lower levels of activity due to adverse weather conditions. Our third fiscal quarter varies greatly with spring rains and wide temperature variations. A cool, wet spring increases drying time on projects, which can delay sales in the third fiscal quarter, while a warm, dry spring may facilitate earlier project commencement dates.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are subject to commodity price risk with respect to price changes in liquid asphalt and energy, including fossil fuels and electricity for aggregates and asphalt paving mix production, natural gas for HMA production and diesel fuel for distribution vehicles and production-related mobile equipment. In order to manage or reduce commodity price risk, we monitor the costs of these commodities at the time of bid and price them into our contracts accordingly. Furthermore, liquid asphalt escalator provisions in most of our public contracts, and in some of our private and commercial contracts, limit our exposure to price fluctuations in this commodity. In addition, we enter into various firm purchase commitments, with terms generally less than one year, for certain raw materials.\nWe have entered into fuel swap contracts to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices. As of September 30, 2020, we had fuel swap contracts to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of 2.5 million gallons, maturing incrementally through fiscal year 2022. The fair value of these derivative contracts was $(0.5) million and $0.0 million respectively, at September 30, 2020 and 2019. The changes in the fair market value of these derivative contracts are recorded in cost of revenues. These fuel swap contracts provide a fixed price for less than 50% of our estimated fuel usage for the remainder of fiscal years 2021 and 2022.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of our short- and long-term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions. We have LIBOR-based floating rate borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in the reference interest rates. From time to time, we use derivative instruments as hedges against the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. In order to hedge against changes in interest rates and to manage\nfluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk, we entered into amortizing interest rate swap agreements (i) on June 30, 2017, with respect to $25.0 million of outstanding debt under the Term Loan, for which we pay a fixed rate of 2.015%, (ii) on May 15, 2018,with respect to $11.0 million of the $22.0 million of additional debt that we borrowed under the Term Loan on that date, for which we pay a fixed percentage rate of 3.01%, (iii) on October 1, 2019, with respect to $5.9 million of the $10.0 million of additional debt that we borrowed under the Term Loan on that date, for which we pay a fixed interest rate of 1.58% and (iv) on February 27, 2020, with respect to $26.3 million of additional debt that we borrowed under the Term Loan on that date, for which we pay a fixed percentage rate of 1.24% and, in each case, under which receive a credit based on the applicable LIBOR rate.\nAt September 30, 2020, we had a total of $92.9 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. Holding other factors constant and absent the interest rate swap agreements described above, a hypothetical 1% change in our borrowing rates would result in a $0.9 million change in our annual interest expense based on our variable rate debt at September 30, 2020.\nItem 7A.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Construction Partners, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Construction Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2017.\nBirmingham, Alabama\nDecember 11, 2020\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(in thousands, except share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - General\nBusiness Description\nConstruction Partners, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the construction and maintenance of roadways across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and residential developments. The Company\u2019s primary operations consist of (i) manufacturing and distributing hot mix asphalt (\u201cHMA\u201d) for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with construction projects, (ii) paving activities, including the construction of roadway base layers and application of asphalt pavement, (iii) site development, including the installation of utility and drainage systems, (iv) mining aggregates, such as sand and gravel, that are used as raw materials in the production of HMA, and (v) distributing liquid asphalt cement for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with HMA production.\nThe Company was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2007 as a holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Construction Partners Holdings, Inc., to facilitate an acquisition growth strategy in the HMA paving and construction industry. On December 31, 2019, Construction Partners Holdings, Inc. merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger. SunTx Capital Partners (\u201cSunTx\u201d), a private equity firm based in Dallas, Texas, is the Company\u2019s majority investor and has owned a controlling interest in the Company\u2019s stock since the Company\u2019s inception.\nManagement\u2019s Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders\u2019 equity, revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are used in accounting for items such as recognition of revenues and cost of revenues, goodwill and other intangible assets, business acquisition accounting estimates, valuation of operating lease right-of-use assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation allowances related to income taxes, accruals for potential liabilities related to lawsuits or insurance claims, the fair value of derivative instruments and the fair value of equity-based compensation awards. Estimates are continually evaluated based on historical information and actual experience; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d) enacted in 2012. As an emerging growth company, the Company could have taken advantage of an exemption that would have allowed the Company to wait to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until the effective date of such standards for private companies. However, the Company has irrevocably elected to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a new or revised standard has different effective dates for public and private companies, the Company is required to adopt the standard at the effective date applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash consists principally of currency on hand and demand deposits at commercial banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Cash equivalents include investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains demand accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit at several banks. From time to time, account balances have exceeded the maximum available federal deposit insurance coverage limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and regularly monitors its credit risk.\nContracts Receivable Including Retainage, net\nContracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts currently due but unbilled, and amounts retained by customers pending completion of a project. It is common in the Company\u2019s industry for a small portion of either\nprogress billings or the contract price, typically 10%, to be withheld by the customer until the Company completes a project to the satisfaction of the customer in accordance with the applicable contract terms. Such amounts, defined as retainage, represent a contract asset and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as \u201cContracts receivable including retainage, net.\u201d Based on the Company\u2019s experience with similar contracts in recent years, billings for such retainage balances are generally collected within one year of the completion of the project.\nThe carrying value of contracts receivable including retainage, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts represents their estimated net realizable value. Management provides for uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts, type of service performed, and current economic conditions. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts and an adjustment of the contract receivable.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nBilling practices for the Company\u2019s contracts are governed by the contract terms of each project based on (i) progress toward completion approved by the owner, (ii) achievement of milestones or (iii) pre-agreed schedules. Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost input method (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method). The Company records contract assets and contract liabilities to account for these differences in timing.\nThe contract asset, \u201cCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts,\u201d arises when the Company recognizes revenues for services performed under its construction projects, but the Company is not yet entitled to bill the customer under the terms of the contract. Amounts billed to customers are excluded from this asset and reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as \u201cContracts receivable including retainage, net.\u201d Included in costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are amounts the Company seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for (i) errors, (ii) changes in contract specifications or design, (iii) contract change orders in dispute, unapproved as to scope and price, or (iv) other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (such as claims). Such amounts are recorded to the extent that the amount can be reasonably estimated and recovery is probable. Claims and unapproved change orders made by the Company may involve negotiation and, in rare cases, litigation. Unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates, and revenues associated with unapproved change orders and claims are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company did not recognize any material amounts associated with claims and unapproved change orders during the periods presented.\nThe contract liability, \u201cBillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts,\u201d represents the Company\u2019s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has been paid by the customer or for which the Company has billed the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue for future services reflected in this account are recognized, and the liability is reduced, as the Company subsequently satisfies the performance obligation under the contract.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are typically resolved within one year and are not considered significant financing components.\nConcentration of Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of contracts receivable including retainage. In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit to its customers and does not generally require collateral. The Company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with these receivables on an ongoing basis. The Company has not historically experienced significant credit losses, due primarily to management\u2019s assessment of customers\u2019 credit ratings. The Company principally deals with recurring customers, state and local governments and well-known local companies whose reputations are known to management. The Company performs credit checks for significant new customers and generally requires progress payments for significant projects. The Company generally has the ability to file liens against the property if payments are not made on a timely basis. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s contracts receivable including retainage, net balance at September 30, 2020 or September 30, 2019.\nProjects performed for various Departments of Transportation accounted for 32.5% and 40.4% of consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Customers that accounted for more than 10.0% of consolidated revenues during either of those periods are presented below:\nInventories\nThe Company\u2019s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are accounted for on an average cost basis or a first-in, first-out cost basis. The cost of inventory includes the cost of material, labor, trucking and other equipment costs associated with procuring and transporting materials to HMA plants for production and delivery to customers. Inventories consist primarily of raw materials, including asphalt cement, aggregate and millings that the Company expects to utilize on construction projects within one year.\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company derives all of its revenues from contracts with its customers, predominantly by performing construction services for both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential developments. These projects are performed for a mix of federal, state, municipal and private customers. In addition, the Company generates revenues from the sale of construction materials, including HMA, aggregates, liquid asphalt and ready-mix concrete, to third-party public and private customers pursuant to contracts with those customers. The following table reflects, for the periods presented, (i) revenues generated from public infrastructure construction projects and the sale of construction materials to public customers and (ii) revenues generated from private infrastructure construction projects and the sale of construction materials to private customers.\nRevenues derived from construction projects are recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of the asset created or enhanced by the project to the customer. Recognition of revenues and cost of revenues for construction projects requires significant judgment by management, including, among other things, estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete a project and measuring progress toward completion. Management reviews contract estimates regularly to assess revisions of estimated costs to complete a project and measurement of progress toward completion. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, revisions in estimates related to amounts recorded in prior periods resulted in the Company recording net increases in revenues of $1.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively.\nManagement believes the Company maintains reasonable estimates based on prior experience; however, many factors contribute to changes in estimates of contract costs. Accordingly, estimates made with respect to uncompleted projects are subject to change as each project progresses and better estimates of contract costs become available. All contract costs are recorded as incurred, and revisions to estimated total costs are reflected as soon as the obligation to perform is determined. Provisions are recognized for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue, regardless of the stage of completion. When the Company incurs additional costs related to work performed by subcontractors, the Company may be able to utilize contractual provisions to back charge the subcontractors for those costs. A reduction to costs related to back charges is recognized when estimated recovery is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Contract costs consist of (i) direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, and amounts payable to subcontractors and (ii) indirect costs related to contract performance, such as insurance, employee benefits, and equipment (primarily depreciation, fuel, maintenance and repairs).\nProgress toward completion is estimated using the input method, measured by the relationship of total cost incurred through the measurement date to total estimated costs required to complete the project (cost-to-cost method). The Company believes this method best depicts the transfer of goods and services to the customer because it represents satisfaction of the Company\u2019s performance obligation under the contract, which occurs as the Company incurs costs. The Company measures percentage of completion based on the performance of a single performance obligation under its construction projects. Each of the Company\u2019s construction contracts represents a single performance obligation to complete a defined construction project. This is because goods and services promised for\ndelivery to a customer are not distinct, as the customer cannot benefit from any individual portion of the services on its own. All deliverables under a contract are part of a project defined by a customer and represent a series of integrated goods and services that have the same pattern of delivery to the customer and use the same measure of progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation as the customer\u2019s asset is created or enhanced by the Company. The Company\u2019s obligation is not satisfied until the entire project is complete.\nRevenue recognized during a reporting period is based on the cost-to-cost input method applied to the total transaction price, including adjustments for variable consideration, such as liquidated damages, penalties or bonuses, related to the timeliness or quality of project performance. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled or the most likely amount the Company expects to incur, in the case of liquidated damages or penalties. Such amounts are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company accounts for changes to the estimated transaction price using a cumulative catch-up adjustment.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, the Company is committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). The Company\u2019s private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to estimated revenues and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nChange orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract and become part of the single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. This is because goods and services promised under change orders are generally not distinct from the remaining goods and services under the existing contract, due to the significant integration of services performed in the context of the contract. Accordingly, change orders are generally accounted for as a modification of the existing contract and single performance obligation. We account for the modification using a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Either the Company or its customers may initiate change orders, which may include changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work.\nRevenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates, ready-mix concrete, and liquid asphalt are recognized at a point in time, which is when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Generally, that point in time is when the customer accepts delivery at its facility or receives product in its own transport vehicles from one of the Company\u2019s HMA plants. Upon purchase, the Company generally provides an invoice or similar document detailing the goods transferred to the customer. The Company generally offers payment terms customary in the industry, which typically require payment ranging from point-of-sale to 30 days following purchase.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures and discloses certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Inputs used to measure fair value are classified using the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data.\nLevel 3. Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The inputs used in the determination of fair value are based on the best information available under the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, contracts receivable including retainage and accounts payable reflected as current assets and current liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2020 and 2019. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, management considers their carrying value to approximate their fair value.\nThe Company also has term loans and a revolving credit facility, as described in Note 11 - Debt. The carrying value of amounts outstanding under these credit facilities is reflected as long-term debt, net of current maturities and current maturities of debt on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2020 and 2019. Due to the variable rate or short-term nature of these instruments, management considers their carrying value to approximate their fair value.\nThe Company also has derivative instruments. The fair value of commodity and interest rate swaps are based on forward and spot prices, as described in Note 22 - Fair Value Measurements.\nManagement applies fair value measurement guidance to its impairment analysis for tangible and intangible assets.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired as a business combination, at fair value and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements for operating leases are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Quarry reserves are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregate is extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves. Routine repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Asset improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment categories are as follows:\nManagement periodically assesses the estimated useful life over which assets are depreciated, depleted or amortized. If the analysis warrants a change in the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, management will reduce the estimated useful life and depreciate, deplete or amortize the carrying value prospectively over the shorter remaining useful life.\nThe carrying amounts of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated in the period of disposal, and the resulting gains and losses are included in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income during the same period.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets, or an asset group, may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might cause management to perform impairment testing include, but are not limited to, (i) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (ii) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition, (iii) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset, (iv) an operating or cash flow performance combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, and (v) an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If indicators of potential impairment are present, management performs a recoverability test and, if necessary, records an impairment loss. If the total estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset or asset group is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income, measured as the amount required to reduce the carrying value to fair value. Fair value is determined in accordance with the best available information based on the hierarchy described under \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d above. For example, the Company would first seek to identify quoted prices or other observable market data. If observable data is not available, management would apply the best available information under the circumstances to a technique, such as a discounted cash flow model, to estimate fair value. Impairment analysis involves estimates and the use of assumptions in connection with judgments made in forecasting long-term estimated inflows and outflows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset, and determining the ultimate useful lives of assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions, which could materially impact the results of an impairment assessment.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Other intangible assets consist of an indefinite-lived trade name license in connection with a business acquired, and finite-lived assets, including a non-compete agreement, customer relationships and construction backlog, each acquired in business acquisitions. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, management evaluates whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Judgments regarding indicators of potential impairment are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business.\nAnnually, on the first day of the Company\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter, management performs an analysis of the carrying value of goodwill at its reporting unit for potential impairment. In accordance with GAAP, the Company may assess its goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach to determine whether conditions exist to indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If management concludes, based on its assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value is greater than its fair value, then a quantitative analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any impairment. The Company may also elect to initially perform a quantitative analysis instead of starting with a qualitative assessment. Because the Company has only one reporting unit, a market capitalization calculation can be performed as the first step of the quantitative assessment by comparing the book value of the Company\u2019s stock (determined by reference to the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity) to the fair value of a share of the Company\u2019s stock. If the fair value of the stock is greater than the book value of the stock, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the fair value is less than the calculated book value, then the Company must take a second step to determine the impairment amount, as described below.\nThe second step requires comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to its fair value, typically using the multiple period discounting method under the income approach and market approach. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow model, which involves significant estimates and assumptions, including preparation of revenues and profitability growth forecasts, selection of a discount rate, and selection of a terminal year multiple, to estimate fair value. The market approach could include applying a control premium to the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock or utilizing guideline public company multiples. Management\u2019s assessment of facts and circumstances at each analysis date could cause these assumptions to change. If the fair value of the respective reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write down goodwill to its fair value and is recorded in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill using the market capitalization calculation for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 and determined that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired at September 30, 2020 or 2019. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or performed.\nManagement also annually assesses the carrying value of the Company\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value. An impairment loss is recorded in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income to the extent that the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. Similar to the assessment of goodwill, events and changes in circumstances could cause management to utilize different assumptions in subsequent evaluations, which could materially impact the results of an impairment assessment. Management concluded that the carrying value of the Company\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill was not impaired at September 30, 2020 or 2019.\nDeferred Debt Issuance Costs\nCosts directly associated with obtaining debt financing are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt agreement. Unamortized amounts related to long-term debt are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related long-term debt liability.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is a measure of net income and all other changes in equity that result from transactions other than transactions with stockholders. Management has determined that net income is the Company\u2019s only component of comprehensive income. Accordingly, there is no difference between net income and comprehensive income.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal and state income taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which the temporary differences are\nexpected to be reversed or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management evaluates the realization of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented on a net basis by taxing authority and classified as non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit of the Company\u2019s tax positions that are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained. The Company classifies income tax-related interest and penalties as interest expense and other expenses, respectively. Refer to Note 15 - Provision for Income Taxes for further information regarding our federal and state income taxes.\nEquity-Based Incentive Plans\nCompensation costs related to equity-classified share-based awards are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on grant date fair value. Compensation cost for graded-vesting awards is recognized ratably over the respective vesting periods.\nAccrued Insurance Costs\nThe Company carries insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily including general liability, automobile liability and workers\u2019 compensation, under which it is liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid. The amount for which the Company is liable for general liability, automobile liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims ranges from $100,000 to $500,000 per occurrence. Management accrues insurance costs for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified, if necessary, by recent events. Changes in loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would affect the assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial position up to $500,000 per occurrence for general liability, automobile liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims.\nThe Company provides employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the insurance company. Under the self-insured policies, the Company is liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. The Company purchases separate stop-loss insurance that limits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $100,000 to $160,000.\nIn addition to the retention items noted above, the Company\u2019s insurance provider requires the Company to maintain a standby letter of credit. This letter of credit serves as a guarantee by the banking institution to pay the Company\u2019s insurance provider the incurred claim costs attributable to general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and automobile liability claims, up to the amount stated in the standby letter of credit, in the event that these claims are not paid by the Company (see Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies).\nEarnings per Share\nBasic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders, but includes dilutive unvested stock awards using the treasury stock method.\nSegment Reporting and Reporting Units\nThe Company operates in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina through its wholly owned subsidiaries located in four southeastern states. Each of the Company\u2019s platform operating companies engages in essentially the same business, which consists primarily of infrastructure and road construction.\nManagement determined that the Company functions as a single operating segment, and thus reports as a single reportable segment. This determination is based on rules prescribed by GAAP applied to the manner in which management operates the Company. In particular, management assessed the discrete financial information routinely reviewed by the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), its Chief Executive Officer, to monitor the Company\u2019s operating performance and support decisions regarding allocation of resources to its operations. Specifically, performance is continuously monitored at the consolidated level and at the individual contract level to timely identify deviations from expected results. Resource allocations are based on the capacity of the Company\u2019s operating facilities to pursue new project opportunities, including reallocation of assets that are underutilized from time to time at a certain operating facility to another operating facility where additional resources might be required to fully meet demand. Other factors further supporting this conclusion include substantial similarities throughout all of the Company\u2019s operations with respect to services provided, type of customers, sourcing of materials and manufacturing and delivery methodologies.\nManagement further determined that, based on their economic similarities, the Company\u2019s five platform operating companies, representing components, should be aggregated into one reporting unit for purposes of assessing potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. These legal entities represent material acquisitions that occurred over time in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina pursuant to the Company\u2019s strategic growth strategy. Each platform company is managed by its president, who has primary responsibility for the respective operating company. Collectively, these presidents are directly accountable to, and maintain regular contact with, the CODM as a team to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and operating plans for the Company\u2019s single operating segment.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income.\nNote 3 - Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nASC Topic 842\nASC Topic 842, Leases (\u201cTopic 842\u201d) requires lessees to recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as described below. Prior to the adoption of Topic 842, operating leases were expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income, and the Company did not recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company adopted Topic 842 effective October 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach with no prior-period retrospective adjustments. As a result, on the adoption date, the Company recognized (i) a net cumulative decrease to retained earnings of $0.2 million, (ii) additional operating lease right-of-use assets of $9.1 million, (iii) current operating lease liabilities of $2.9 million and (iv) non-current operating lease liabilities of $6.4 million. The Company elected to apply optional practical expedients that\nallowed the Company to forego reassessments of (i) the classification of leases existing at the date of adoption, (ii) the initial direct costs of any existing leases and (iii) whether any expired or existing contracts were, or contained, leases. Accordingly, prior comparable periods were not restated.\nIn connection with the adoption of Topic 842, the Company implemented several accounting policies relating to the identification and measurement of operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. At the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether a contract contains a lease by assessing whether the contract conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If so, the Company measures and records an operating lease liability equal to the present value of the future lease payments. Because most of the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate is used in determining the present value of lease payments. The amount of the operating lease right-of-use asset consists of: (i) the amount of the initial measurement of the operating lease liability; (ii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received; and (iii) any initial direct costs incurred. The present value calculation may account for an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option.\nThe Company has elected not to apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) or leases to explore for or use minerals. Instead, for these types of leases, the Company recognizes lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nThe FASB has issued certain Accounting Standards Updates (\u201cASUs\u201d) that are applicable to the Company and will be adopted in future periods. The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 do not reflect the requirements of this guidance. The following is a brief description of recently issued ASUs and management\u2019s current assessment regarding the methods, timing and impact of adoption of such ASUs by the Company in the future.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\u201cTopic 326\u201d), which introduces an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses. The amendments pursuant to Topic 326 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company expects to adopt this guidance as required and does not expect such adoption to cause a material impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (\u201cASU 2018-15\u201d). This ASU requires customers in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to capitalize certain implementation costs as if the arrangement was an internal-use software project. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company expects to adopt this guidance as required and does not expect such adoption to cause a material impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nNote 4 - Business Acquisitions\nAlabama Acquisition - July 2019\nOn July 12, 2019, a subsidiary of the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of an HMA manufacturing plant and paving company located near Gadsden, Alabama. The acquired business is expected to benefit from synergies resulting from its proximity to the Company\u2019s preexisting operations in northeast Alabama, including an aggregates quarry. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. The purchase price of $5.0 million was paid from cash on hand at closing.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values based on the methodology described under \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies. The amounts allocated were not material to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of the purchase price exceeding the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill in the amount of approximately $2.4 million, which is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill primarily represents the assembled work force and synergies expected to result from the acquisition.\nThe results of operations since the July 12, 2019 acquisition date attributable to this acquisition are included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and were not material to the Consolidated Statements of Income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Pro forma results of operations as if the acquisition had been consummated on October 1, 2018 would not be material to the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe Company recorded certain costs to effect the acquisition as they were incurred, which are reflected as general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the amount of $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nFlorida Acquisition - February 2019\nOn February 28, 2019, a subsidiary of the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of an HMA and ready-mix concrete business located in Okeechobee, Florida. This transaction enables the Company to serve new markets in south central Florida through an expanded geographic presence in the state. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. The purchase price of $8.9 million was paid from cash on hand at closing.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values based on the methodology described under \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies. The amounts allocated were not material to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The purchase price exceeding the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships and customer backlog, in the amount of $3.2 million, which is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill primarily represents the assembled work force and synergies expected to result from the acquisition.\nThe results of operations since the February 28, 2019 acquisition date attributable to this acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date and were not material to the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year fiscal ended September 30, 2019. Pro forma results of operations as if the acquisition had been consummated on October 1, 2018 would not be material to the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe Company recorded certain costs to effect the acquisition as they were incurred, which are reflected as general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the amount of $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nFlorida Acquisition - October 2019\nOn October 1, 2019, a subsidiary of the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of an HMA manufacturing plant and paving company located in Palm City, Florida. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (\u201cTopic 805\u201d). The purchase price of $17.7 million was paid from cash on hand at closing.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values based on the methodology described under Fair Value Measurements in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies. The amounts allocated were not material to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of the purchase price exceeding the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill in the amount of approximately $7.7 million, which is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill primarily represents the assembled work force and synergies expected to result from the acquisition.\nThe results of operations since the October 1, 2019 acquisition date attributable to this acquisition are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements and were not material to the Consolidated Statements of Income for the fiscal year ended September, 30, 2020.\nThe Company recorded certain costs to effect the acquisition as they were incurred, which are reflected in general and administrative expenses on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income in the amount of $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nFlorida Acquisition - March 2020\nOn March 23, 2020, a subsidiary of the Company acquired two HMA manufacturing plants and certain related assets located in Pensacola and DeFuniak Springs, Florida. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Topic 805. The $9.8 million purchase price was paid in cash at closing, with an additional $2.7 million of cash paid for plant inventory.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values based on the methodology described under Fair Value Measurements in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies. The amounts allocated were not material to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of the purchase price exceeding the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill in the amount of approximately $0.1 million, which is deductible for income tax purposes.

Debt at September 30, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nThe Company and each of its subsidiaries are parties to a credit agreement with BBVA USA (formerly known as Compass Bank), as agent, issuing bank and a lender, and certain other lenders (as amended and restated, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) and a revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets.\nFollowing an amendment and restatement of the Credit Agreement in July 2020, the principal amount of Term Loan advances made prior to April 30, 2020 is repaid in quarterly installments of $2,050,000, and the principal amount of Term Loan advances made on or after April 30, 2020 is repaid in quarterly installments of $1,200,000, in each case beginning on September 30, 2020 and at the end of each calendar quarter thereafter. Interest is due and payable on the last business day of each month.

The Company generally may (and must, under certain circumstances), subject to various requirements, prepay all or a portion of the outstanding balance of the advances, together with accrued interest thereon, prior to their contractual maturity.\nAt September 30, 2020 and 2019, there was $92.9 million and $44.7 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Term Loan, $0.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and availability of $39.3 million and $14.4 million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility, including reduction for outstanding letters of credit.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to make acquisitions, make loans or advances, make capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends, create or incur indebtedness, create liens, wind up or dissolve, consolidate, merge or liquidate, or sell, transfer or dispose of assets. The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20-to-1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 2.75-to-1.00, subject to certain adjustments. At September 30, 2020 and 2019,\nthe Company\u2019s fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.85-to-1.00 and 4.04-to-1.00, respectively, and the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio was 1.08-to-1.00 and 0.66-to-1.00, respectively.

These interest rate swap agreements do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate notional value of these interest rate swap agreements was $46.5 million and $21.5 million, respectively, and the fair value was $(1.7) million and $(0.3) million, respectively, which is included within other liabilities on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe scheduled contractual repayment terms of long-term debt at September 30, 2020 were as follows:\nInterest expense was $3.6 million and $3.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, and the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, unless otherwise required by applicable law or the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at any time at the option of the holder or upon any transfer, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, upon the election of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock will be converted into shares of Class A common stock. Once converted into shares of Class A common stock, shares of Class B common stock will not be reissued. Class A common stock is not convertible into any other class of the Company\u2019s capital stock.\nConversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, certain stockholders of the Company converted a total of 1,278,148 shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.

No restricted shares of Class A common stock were issued, and no options to purchase shares of Class A or Class B common stock were exercised, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nAdditional information about these transactions is set forth in Note 14 - Equity-Based Compensation.\nAmendment to the Equity Incentive Plan\nOn May 24, 2019, the Company adopted an amendment to the Equity Incentive Plan relating to exceptions from the $750,000 limit on the aggregate dollar value of equity-based awards granted during any calendar year to a non-employee director. Prior to the adoption of the amendment, the limit could be multiplied by two with respect to awards granted in the calendar year in which a non-employee director first joined the Company\u2019s board of directors. The amendment changed the period within which the aggregate value of equity-based awards may be multiplied by two to be the calendar year in which a non-employee director is first granted equity-based awards under the Equity Incentive Plan.\nRegistration Rights Agreement\nThe Company is a party to a registration rights agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) with certain of the Company\u2019s directors and officers and affiliates of SunTx (collectively, the \u201cRRA Holders\u201d). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the RRA Holders have \u201cdemand\u201d registration rights, meaning that the Company must register under the Securities Act shares of the Company\u2019s common stock owned by such RRA Holders upon their demand under certain circumstances, and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights, meaning that, if the Company proposes to register an offering of securities, it generally must give written notice to the RRA Holders to allow each to include its shares in the registration. In general, the Company must pay all out-of-pocket expenses in connection with a registration under the Registration Rights Agreement, including filing and registration fees, printing costs, fees and expenses of the Company\u2019s legal counsel and independent registered public accountants and fees and expenses for one legal counsel for the applicable RRA Holders. The RRA Holders whose shares are registered must pay all incremental selling expenses relating to any offering, such as underwriters\u2019 commissions and discounts, brokerage fees, underwriter marketing costs and any additional legal counsel that they may engage. As of September 30, 2020, a total of 22,235,744 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock were subject to the Registration Rights Agreement, of which 4,848,010 shares had been previously registered but not yet sold. The Registration Rights Agreement expires on May 4, 2023.\nSecondary Offerings of Class A Common Stock\nIn September 2019, certain stockholders of the Company (the \u201cSelling Stockholders\u201d) completed an underwritten secondary offering (the \u201c2019 Secondary Offering\u201d) of 5,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $14.25 per share. In addition, the underwriters of the 2019 Secondary Offering exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of Class A common stock from the Selling Stockholders. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders and, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, incurred approximately $0.7 million in expenses in connection with the 2019 Secondary Offering.\nIn June 2020, the Selling Stockholders completed an underwritten secondary offering (the \u201c2020 Secondary Offering\u201d) of 5,750,000 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $16.50 per share.

The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders and, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, incurred approximately $0.2 million in expenses in connection with the 2020 Secondary Offering.\nNote 13 - Earnings Per Share\nAs discussed in Note 12 - Equity, the Company has Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Because the only differences between the two classes of common stock are related to voting rights, conversion rights and transfer restrictions applicable to shares of Class B common stock, the Company has not presented earnings per share under the two-class method, as the earnings per share are the same for both Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The following table summarizes the weighted-average number of basic common shares outstanding and the calculation of basic earnings per share for the periods presented (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nThe following table summarizes the calculation of the weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding and the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the periods presented (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nNote 14 - Equity-Based Compensation\nRestricted Stock Awards and Options\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company awarded a total of 292,534 restricted shares of Class A common stock to its non-employee directors under the Equity Incentive Plan in lieu of cash compensation. The grants are classified as equity awards. The aggregate grant date fair value of these restricted stock awards was $3.8 million. The grants will vest as to two-thirds of the underlying shares on January 1, 2021 and as to the remaining one-third of the underlying shares on January 1, 2022. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of compensation expense in connection with these grants, which is reflected as general and administrative expenses in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income. At September 30, 2020, there was approximately $1.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards.\nOption Exercises\nIn August 2019, an employee of the Company exercised an option to purchase 74,592 shares of Class B common stock at a price of $0.0357 per share. The option was granted in March 2017 pursuant to a non-plan option agreement. The option was fully vested upon the date of grant, but, until the option agreement was subsequently amended, the option was exercisable only during the ten-day period immediately preceding a change in control of the Company. In August 2019, the Company and the employee amended the option agreement to (i) adjust the number of underlying shares and exercise price of the option to account for the 25.2-to-1 stock split and share reclassification that occurred in April 2018; (ii) reduce the exercise price (as adjusted) for the shares underlying the option; (iii) make the option immediately exercisable; and (iv) provide that the option would expire on the earlier of December 31, 2019 or the occurrence of one of the other expiration events set forth in the option agreement. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $0.4 million of compensation expense in connection with the option amendment, which is reflected in general administrative expenses on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income. At September 30, 2020, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to the option.\nNote 15 - Provision for Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states. Management evaluated the Company\u2019s tax positions based on appropriate provisions of applicable enacted tax laws and regulations and believes that they are supportable based on their specific technical merits and the facts and circumstances of the transactions.\nThe provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDifferences exist between income and expenses reported on the consolidated financial statements and those deducted for U.S. federal and state income tax reporting. The Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following temporary difference tax effects at September 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2020 and 2019 include gross deferred tax assets of $3.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the weight of all evidence known and available as of the balance sheet date, management believes that these tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized in the future. To the extent that management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.\nIncome taxes payable have been reduced by fuel tax credits of $0.3 million for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The remaining amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes was $22.6 million and $19.0 million at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) to amounts reflected on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nAt September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had a state net operating loss carryforward of $15.3 million and $31.6 million, respectively. The state net operating loss credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts between the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2030.\nThe U.S. statutory federal income tax rate applicable to the Company was 21% during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The following table reconciles income taxes based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company\u2019s income before provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nUncertain Tax Positions\nASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (\u201cASC 740\u201d), prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement model for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nThe Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions in the United States. Tax audits, by their nature, are often complex. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of the calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, management determines whether the benefits of the Company\u2019s tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. The Company performed an analysis of its tax positions and determined that no uncertain tax positions existed at September 30, 2020 or 2019. Accordingly, there was no liability for uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2020 or 2019. Based on the provisions of ASC 740, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2020 or 2019. Due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, the Company\u2019s federal income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 through September 30, 2020 are subject to examination. Various state income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 through September 30, 2020 are also subject to examination.\nNote 16 - Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company offers a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees who are at least 18 years old and have more than one year of service. The Company makes discretionary employer contributions, subject to IRS safe harbor rules. Employer contributions charged to earnings during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $3.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively.\nNote 17 - Related Parties\nOn December 31, 2017, the Company sold an indirect wholly owned subsidiary to an immediate family member of a Senior Vice President of the Company (\u201cPurchaser of subsidiary\u201d) in consideration for an interest-bearing note receivable in the amount of $1.0 million, which approximated the net book value of the disposed entity. At September 30, 2020, $0.1 million and $0.5 million was\nreflected on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining balances on this note receivable. In connection with this transaction, the Company also received an interest-bearing note receivable from the disposed entity (\u201cDisposed entity\u201d) on December 31, 2017 in the amount of $1.0 million representing certain accounts payable of the disposed subsidiary that were paid by the Company. At September 30, 2020, $0.1 million and $0.3 million was reflected on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining balances on this note receivable. Remaining principal and interest payments are scheduled to be made in periodic installments during fiscal year 2021 through fiscal year 2026.\nFrom time to time, the Company conducts or has conducted business with the following related parties:\n\u2022Prior to its acquisition by the Company, a current subsidiary of the Company advanced funds to an entity owned by an immediate family member of a Senior Vice President of the Company in connection with a land development project. The obligations of the borrower entity to repay the advances are guaranteed by a separate entity owned by the same family member of the officer. Amounts outstanding under the advances do not bear interest and are reflected on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet within other assets (\u201cLand Development Project\u201d).\n\u2022Entities owned by immediate family members of a Senior Vice President of the Company perform subcontract work for a subsidiary of the Company, including trucking and grading services (\u201cSubcontracting Services\u201d).\n\u2022From time to time, a subsidiary of the Company provides construction services to various companies owned by family members of a Senior Vice President of the Company (\u201cConstruction Services\u201d).\n\u2022Since June 1, 2014, the Company has been a party to an access agreement with Island Pond Corporate Services, LLC, which provides a location for the Company to conduct business development activities from time to time on a property owned by the Executive Chairman of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cIsland Pond\u201d).\n\u2022The Company purchases vehicles from an entity owned by a family member of a Senior Vice President of the Company (\u201cVehicles - Purchases\u201d).\n\u2022The Company rents vehicles from an entity owned by a family member of a Senior Vice President of the Company (\u201cVehicles - Rent Expense\u201d).\n\u2022Family members of a Senior Vice President of the Company provide consulting services to a subsidiary of the Company (\u201cConsulting Services\u201d).\n\u2022The Company is party to a management services agreement with SunTx, under which the Company pays SunTx $0.25 million per fiscal quarter and reimburses certain travel and other out-of-pocket expenses associated with services rendered under the management services agreement.\nThe following table presents revenues earned and expenses incurred by the Company during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and receivable and accounts payable balances at September 30, 2020 and 2019, related to transactions with the related parties described above (in thousands):\nNote 18 - Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to inquiries or audits by taxing authorities arising from its operations, covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as income taxes and other types of taxes. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may not be resolved in the Company\u2019s favor. The Company is also involved in other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The outcomes of these inquiries and legal proceedings are not expected to have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial position or results of operations on an individual basis, and management did not accrue any material loss contingencies for the periods presented. However, adverse outcomes in a significant number of such ordinary course inquiries and legal proceedings could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLetters of Credit\nUnder the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company has a total capacity of $50.0 million that may be used for a combination of cash borrowings and letter of credit issuances. At each of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had aggregate letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $10.9 million, primarily related to certain insurance policies as described in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies.\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2020, the Company had unconditional purchase commitments for diesel fuel in the normal course of business in the aggregate amount of $1.3 million. Management does not expect any significant changes in the market value of these goods during the commitment period that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. As of September 30, 2020, our purchase commitments annually thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\nNote 19 - Joint Venture\nIn November 2017, one of the Company\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a joint venture agreement (the \u201cJV\u201d) with a third party for the sole purpose of bidding on and performing a construction project for the Alabama Department of Transportation. The Company and the third party each own a 50% partnership interest in the JV and share revenue and expenses equally. The JV is jointly managed by representatives of the Company and the third party, and all labor, material and equipment required to perform the contract is subcontracted, with both of the participants of the JV performing some portion of the subcontracted work.\nThe Company accounts for this joint venture as an equity method investment in accordance with GAAP. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s investment in the JV was $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, which is reflected as \u201cInvestment in joint venture\u201d on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $0.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of pre-tax income, representing its 50% interest in the earnings of the JV, which is reflected as \u201cEarnings from investment in joint venture\u201d on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income. The income tax impact attributable to the Company\u2019s investment in the JV is included within the provision for income taxes in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNote 20 - Settlement Agreement\nOn April 19, 2018, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries entered into settlement agreements with a third party arising from an interruption event not directly related to the Company\u2019s business that the Company does not expect to reoccur (the \u201cSettlement\u201d). The Settlement provided for the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to receive aggregate net payments of approximately $15.7 million in four equal installments between January 2019 and July 2020, in exchange for releasing and waiving all current and future claims against the third party.

As of September 30, 2020, all amounts due pursuant to the Settlement have been received in full.\nNote 21 - Leases\nThe Company leases certain facilities, office space, vehicles and equipment. As of September 30, 2020, operating leases under Topic 842 were included in (i) operating lease right-of use assets, (ii) current portion of operating lease liabilities and (iii) operating lease liabilities, net of current portion on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the amounts of $7.4 million, $2.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, the Company did not have any lease contracts that had not yet commenced but had created significant rights and obligations. In October 2019, the Company used cash in the amount of $11.5 million to buy out certain operating lease obligations.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows (in thousands):\nShort-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) are not capitalized but are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The majority of our short-term leases relate to equipment used on construction projects. These leases are entered into at periodic rental rates for an unspecified duration and typically have a termination for convenience provision. Short-term lease cost includes leases with terms of one month or less.\nAs of September 30, 2020, the weighted-average remaining term of the Company\u2019s leases was 8.8 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 4.00%. As of September 30, 2020, the lease liability was equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate on the Company\u2019s secured debt using a single maturity discount rate, as such rate is not materially different from the discount rate applied to each of the leases in the portfolio.\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s undiscounted lease liabilities outstanding as of September 30, 2020 (in thousands):\nThe Company has lease agreements associated with quarry facilities under which the Company makes royalty payments. The payments are generally based on tons sold in a particular period; however, certain agreements have minimum annual payments. Royalty expense recorded in cost of revenue during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively.\nNote 22 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (in thousands):\nDerivative liabilities included in Level 2 include commodity and interest rate swap contracts. The fair values of our Level 2 derivative liabilities are estimated using an analysis of the expected cash flow of the contract in combination with marketable observable inputs, including forward and spot prices for commodity swaps and interest rate curves for interest rate swaps.\nNote 23 - Investment in Derivative Instruments\nThe Company\u2019s operations expose it to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices and changes in interest rates. As part of its risk management process, the Company began entering into commodity swap transactions through regulated commodity exchanges in February 2020. To manage interest rate exposure, the Company has entered into derivative instruments using interest rate swaps. The objective of entering into interest rate swaps is to eliminate the variability of cash\nflows associated with movements in interest rates over the life of the loans.\nThe following table represents the approximate amount of realized and unrealized gains (losses) and changes in fair value recognized in earnings on commodity derivative contracts for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 and the fair value of these derivatives as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nNote 24 - COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic of the novel strain of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, on all aspects of its business, including how it has impacted and may continue to impact the Company\u2019s customers, employees, suppliers, and vendors. While the Company did not incur significant disruptions in its operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 from COVID-19, due to the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on its financial position, operating results and cash flows in future periods.\nNote 25 - Condensed Financial Statements of Parent Company\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nPARENT COMPANY ONLY\nCONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSee note to condensed financial statements of parent company.\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nPARENT COMPANY ONLY\nCONDENSED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nSee note to condensed financial statements of parent company.\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nPARENT COMPANY ONLY\nCONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands)\nSee note to condensed financial statements of parent company.\nNote to Condensed Financial Statements of Parent Company\nOn December 31, 2019, the Company completed an internal reorganization by merging Construction Partners Holdings, Inc. with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger. Therefore, the condensed parent company-only financial statements above reflect the retroactive combination of these entities as if it had occurred on October 1, 2018 for comparative purposes. The presentation change for September 30, 2019 had no effect on previously reported net income of the Company.\nThese condensed parent company-only financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 12-04, Schedule I of Regulation S-X, as the restricted net assets of the subsidiaries of Construction Partners, Inc. (as defined in Rule 4-08(e)(3) of Regulation S-X) exceed 25% of the consolidated net assets of the Company. The ability of Construction Partners, Inc.\u2019s operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of the credit facilities described in Note 11 - Debt.\nThese condensed parent company-only financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting principles and policies described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, with the exception that the parent company accounts for its subsidiaries using the equity method. These condensed parent company-only financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.\nNote 26 - Subsequent Events\nSubsequent to September 30, 2020, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the operations of three asphalt and paving companies in North Carolina. The acquired businesses collectively added eleven hot-mix asphalt plants in North Carolina, providing the Company with access to additional markets and expanding its footprint in the state. The acquisitions will be accounted for as business combinations in accordance with ASC 805. The aggregate purchase price of $57.4 million (exclusive of reimbursement to the respective sellers for inventory assets acquired) was paid from cash on hand at closing.\nIn each case, the provisional allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, was determined in accordance with the methodology described under Fair Value Measurements above in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies. The amount of the purchase price exceeding the preliminary net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is expected to be recorded as goodwill in the aggregate amount of $21.1 million, which is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill primarily represents the assembled workforce and synergies expected to result from the acquisition. Upon finalizing the accounting for this transaction, management expects to ascribe value to other identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships and customer backlog, which will reduce the preliminary amount allocated to goodwill.\nItem 9.",
