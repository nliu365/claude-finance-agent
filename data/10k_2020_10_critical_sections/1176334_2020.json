Our general partner has broad discretion to establish cash reserves that it determines are necessary or appropriate to properly conduct our business. These can include cash reserves for future capital and maintenance expenditures, reserves to stabilize distributions of cash to the unitholders and our general partner, reserves to reduce debt, or, as necessary, reserves to comply with the terms of any of our agreements or obligations. Our distributions are effectively made 98% to unitholders and 2% to our general partner, subject to the payment of incentive distributions to our general partner if certain target cash distribution levels to common unitholders are achieved. Distributions to our general partner increase to 15%, 25% and 50% based on incremental distribution thresholds as set forth in our Partnership Agreement.\nOur ability to distribute available cash is contractually restricted by the terms of our credit facility. Our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios. We are prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if the distribution would cause a default or an event of default, or a default or an event of default exists, under our credit facility.

    "section_7": "Item 7.Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe are a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. Our four primary business lines include:\n\u2022Terminalling, processing, storage and packaging services for petroleum products and by-products including the refining of naphthenic crude oil;\n\u2022Land and marine transportation services for petroleum products and by-products, chemicals, and specialty products;\n\u2022Sulfur and sulfur-based products processing, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution; and\n\u2022NGL marketing, distribution, and transportation services.\nThe petroleum products and by-products we collect, transport, store and market are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas companies who often turn to third parties, such as us, for the transportation and disposition of these products. In addition to these major and independent oil and gas companies, our primary customers include independent refiners, large chemical companies, and other wholesale purchasers of these products. We operate primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. This region is a major hub for petroleum refining, natural gas gathering and processing, and support services for the exploration and production industry.\nSignificant Recent Developments\nSale of Mega Lubricants.\nOn December 22, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement to sell Mega Lubricants to Stone Oil for $22.4 million. Mega Lubricants is engaged in the business of blending, manufacturing and delivering various marine application lubricants, sub-sea specialty fluids, and proprietary developed commercial and industrial products. The transaction closed on December 22, 2020. The proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nExchange Offer and Cash Tender Offer\nOn August 12, 2020, we successfully completed our exchange offer and consent solicitation to certain eligible holders of our 2021 Notes and separate but related cash tender offer and consent solicitation to certain other holders of our 2021 Notes. Please see Note 15 in Part II of this Form 10-K for more information about the exchange offer and related transactions.\nCOVID-19\nCOVID-19 surfaced in late 2019 and has spread around the world, including to the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The Partnership continues to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, the businesses we serve, and the communities where we live and work. To support the safety of all of our employees and operations, precautionary measures were implemented to prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading in our workplace or the locations we serve, including suspending non-essential travel, limiting the number of employees attending meetings, reducing the number of people at our locations at any one time, monitoring the health of all employees, and implementing work-from-home initiatives for all eligible employees. Further, we continue to provide awareness training for all of our drivers, vessel crews, blending operators and other affected personnel regarding preventative measures in or around our docks, vessels, and trucks and locations to which they are delivering. Our communication lines are open 24/7 for the environmental health and safety division, land and marine logistics, and sales and marketing teams.\nDue to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the markets experienced a decline in oil prices in response to oil demand concerns. These concerns were further exacerbated by the price war among members of OPEC and other non-OPEC producer nations during the first quarter of 2020 and global storage considerations. Travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders implemented by governments in many regions and countries across the globe, including the United States, have greatly impacted the demand for refined products resulting in a significant reduction in refinery utilization, which has impacted our 2020 performance. This impact started in February of 2020 and continued through the end of the year, during which time we have seen unfavorable trends in certain key metrics across several of our business lines compared to historical periods. The\nsignificant reduction in refinery utilization as a result of reduced refined products demand significantly impacted our Transportation and NGL segments. As the volume of products produced or purchased by refineries has been reduced, demand for our services has decreased.\nLooking forward, we expect to continue to experience some adverse impacts of COVID-19 in our transportation segment during the first half of 2021 but we believe that refinery utilization will continue to increase in the second half of 2021 as a result of widespread vaccinations, government stimulus, and a rebounding economy. This should ultimately improve refined product demand as people get back to work and begin traveling again. We expect this will positively impact our transportation segment as demand for our services improves.\nThe extent to which the duration and severity of the pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Accordingly, the full impact of COVID-19 will not be reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. Management also assessed the extent to which the current macroeconomic events brought about by COVID-19 and significant declines in refined product demand impacted the valuation of expected credit losses on accounts receivable and certain inventory items or resulted in modifications to any significant contracts. Ultimately the results of these assessments did not have a material impact on our results as of December 31, 2020.\nSubsequent Events\nRetirement of 2021 Notes. On February 15, 2021, our 2021 Notes matured and we retired the outstanding balance of $28.8 million using our revolving credit facility.\nQuarterly Distribution. On January 25, 2021, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.005 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2020, or $0.02 per common unit on an annualized basis, which was paid on February 12, 2021 to unitholders of record as of February 5, 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. We prepared these financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\" or \"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We routinely evaluate these estimates, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Our results may differ from these estimates, and any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. You should also read Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies\" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table evaluates the potential impact of estimates utilized during the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur Relationship with Martin Resource Management Corporation\nMartin Resource Management Corporation directs our business operations through its ownership and control of our general partner and under the Omnibus Agreement. In addition to the direct expenses payable to Martin Resource Management Corporation under the Omnibus Agreement, we are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for indirect general and administrative and corporate overhead expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the board of directors of our general partner approved reimbursement amounts of $16.4 million, $16.7 million and $16.4 million, respectively, reflecting our allocable share of such expenses. The board of directors of our general partner will review and approve future adjustments in the reimbursement amount for indirect expenses, if any, annually.\nWe are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for all direct expenses it incurs or payments it makes on our behalf or in connection with the operation of our business. Martin Resource Management Corporation also licenses certain of its trademarks and trade names to us under the Omnibus Agreement.\nWe are both an important supplier to and customer of Martin Resource Management Corporation. All of these services and goods are purchased and sold pursuant to the terms of a number of agreements between us and Martin Resource Management Corporation. For a more comprehensive discussion concerning the Omnibus Agreement and the other agreements that we have entered into with Martin Resource Management Corporation, please see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\"\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements other than our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to analyze our performance. These include: (1) net income before interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), (2) adjusted EBITDA and (3) distributable cash flow. Our management views these measures as important performance measures of core profitability for our operations and the ability to generate and distribute cash flow, and as key components of our internal financial reporting. We believe investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Certain items excluded from EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity's financial performance, such as cost of capital and historic costs of depreciable assets. We have included information concerning EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because they provide investors and management with additional information to better understand the following: financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other similarly situated entities; and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects. Our method of computing adjusted EBITDA may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other entities. The economic substance behind our use of adjusted EBITDA is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness and make distributions to our unit holders.\nDistributable Cash Flow. Distributable cash flow is a significant performance measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash flows generated by us to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders. Distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates. Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit's yield, which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our method of computing these measures may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other entities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measurements used by management to our most directly comparable GAAP measures for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, which represents EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow from continuing operations.\nReconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 have been derived from our consolidated financial statements. Discussions of the year ended December 31, 2018 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and year-to-year comparisons of the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018 can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe evaluate segment performance on the basis of operating income, which is derived by subtracting cost of products sold, operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense from revenues.\nOur consolidated results of operations are presented on a comparative basis below. There are certain items of income and expense which we do not allocate on a segment basis. These items, including interest expense, and indirect selling, general and administrative expenses, are discussed after the comparative discussion of our results within each segment.\nThe Natural Gas Liquids segment information below excludes the discontinued operations of the Natural Gas Storage Assets and WTLPG partnership interests disposed of on June 28, 2019 and July 31, 2018, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Item 8, Note 5.\nThe following table sets forth our operating revenues and operating income by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nTerminalling and Storage Segment\nComparative Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nServices revenues. Services revenue decreased $6.3 million, of which $3.8 million was primarily a result of expiring capital recovery fees at our Smackover refinery and decreased fees related to a crude pipeline gathering rate adjustment. In addition, revenue from shore-based terminals decreased $2.1 million primarily due to decreased throughput of $3.2 million and consigned lube revenue of $0.6 million, offset by $1.0 million related to contract termination fees, and $0.8 million in space rental income. Revenue from specialty terminals decreased $0.3 million due to $1.2 million in decreased throughput rates, offset by $0.8 million related to a new contract.\nProducts revenues. A 22% decrease in lubricant sales volumes combined with a 13% decrease in average sales price at our shore-based terminals resulted in a $10.3 million decrease to products revenues. In addition, a 7% decrease in average sales price combined with a 2% decrease in sales volumes at our blending and packaging facilities resulted in an $8.8 million decrease in products revenues.\nCost of products sold. A 22% decrease in sales volumes combined with a 14% decrease in average cost per gallon at our shore-based terminals resulted in a $9.8 million decrease in cost of products sold. In addition, an 11% decrease in average cost per gallon combined with a 2% decrease in sales volume at our blending and packaging facilities resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in cost of products sold.\nOperating expenses.

Revenue was also impacted by a decrease in pass-through revenue (primarily fuel) of $3.3 million.\nLand Transportation Revenues. An 11% decrease in miles of product transported resulted in a decrease to freight revenue of $11.5 million. Transportation rates increased 2% resulting in an offsetting increase of $1.5 million. Additionally, fuel surcharge revenue decreased $6.6 million.\nOperating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of decreased pass through expenses (primarily fuel) of $8.5 million, compensation expense of $8.1 million, repairs and maintenance of $2.1 million, and outside services of $0.7 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent.\nDepreciation and amortization.

Other operating loss represents losses from the disposition of property, plant and equipment.\nSulfur Services Segment\nComparative Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nServices Revenues. Services revenues increased slightly as a result of a contractually prescribed, index-based fee adjustment.\nProducts Revenues. Products revenues decreased $2.7 million as a result of a 3% decline in average sulfur services sales prices. Products revenues decreased an additional $0.8 million due to a 1% decrease in sales volumes, primarily related to a 3% decrease in sulfur volumes.\nCost of products sold. A 12% decline in product cost impacted cost of products sold by $8.3 million, resulting from a decrease in commodity prices. A 1% decrease in sales volumes resulted in an additional decrease in cost of products sold of $0.5 million. Margin per ton increased $6.09, or 20%.\nOperating expenses. Our operating expenses increased $0.4 million due to insurance claims and $0.4 million due to outside towing. Offsetting were decreases in marine fuel and lube of $0.3 million, assist tugs of $0.1 million and repairs and maintenance of $0.1 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses.

Other operating income, net increased $2.7 million as a result of business interruption recoveries related to downtime associated with the Neches ship-loader insurance claim received in the first quarter of 2020. An additional $4.1 million increase is related to a net gain from the disposition of property, plant and equipment.\nGain on involuntary conversion of property, plant and equipment. The $4.8 million gain is primarily due to insurance proceeds received related to structural damage of our ship-loader assets during a weather incident at our Neches Terminal in May of 2019.\nNatural Gas Liquids Segment\nComparative Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nProducts Revenues. Our NGL average sales price per barrel decreased $10.51, or 28%, resulting in a decrease to products revenues of $103.2 million. The decrease in average sales price per barrel was a result of a decrease in market prices. Product sales volumes decreased 6%, decreasing revenues $15.8 million.\nCost of products sold. Our average cost per barrel decreased $10.07, or 29%, decreasing cost of products sold by $98.9 million. The decrease in average cost per barrel was a result of a decrease in market prices. The decrease in sales volume of 6% resulted in a $14.6 million decrease to cost of products sold. Our margins decreased $0.44 per barrel, or 18% during the period.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses decreased $2.3 million related to the divestiture of assets and the elimination of the associated expenses. In addition, operating expenses decreased $1.0 million related to the settlement of an insurance claim for less than anticipated.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses.

This allocation is based on the percentage of time spent by Martin Resource Management Corporation personnel that provide such centralized services. GAAP also permits other methods for allocation of these expenses, such as basing the allocation on the percentage of revenues contributed by a segment. The allocation of these expenses between Martin Resource Management Corporation and us is subject to a number of judgments and estimates, regardless of the method used. We can provide no assurances that our method of allocation, in the past or in the future, is or will be the most accurate or appropriate method of allocation for these expenses. Other methods could result in a higher allocation of selling, general and administrative expense to us, which would reduce our net income.\nUnder the Omnibus Agreement, we are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for indirect general and administrative and corporate overhead expenses. The board of directors of our general partner approved the following reimbursement amounts:\nThe amounts reflected above represent our allocable share of such expenses. The board of directors of our general partner will review and approve future adjustments in the reimbursement amount for indirect expenses, if any, annually.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary sources of liquidity to meet operating expenses, service our indebtedness, pay distributions to our unitholders and fund capital expenditures have historically been cash flows generated by our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt and equity capital markets, both public and private. Set forth below is a description of our cash flows for the periods indicated.\nCash Flows - Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table details the cash flow changes between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nNet cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $7.8 million decrease in net cash received from discontinued operating activities, a decrease in operating results of $11.3 million, and an unfavorable variance in other non-current assets and liabilities of $0.9 million. An additional $6.0 million decrease in other non-cash charges was primarily due to a $4.9 million gain on involuntary conversion of property, plant and equipment. Offsetting this decrease was a favorable variance in working capital of $15.0 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $172.2 million. Cash received from discontinued investing activities decreased $209.2 million. Offsetting such decrease, net proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment increased $4.5 million and proceeds received from the involuntary conversion of property, plant and equipment increased $2.5 million. A decrease in cash used of $6.2 million resulted from higher payments for capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs in 2019 as well as a decrease of $23.7 million in cash used resulting from assets acquired from MTI in January of 2019.\nNet cash used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased primarily as a result of a $102.4 million decrease in cash used related to excess purchase price over the carrying value of acquired assets in common control transactions during 2019. Additionally, net payments of long-term borrowings decreased $35.3 million and cash distributions paid decreased $43.8 million. Offsetting such decrease, costs associated with our credit facility increased $0.6 million.\nTotal Contractual Obligations\nA summary of our total contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThe interest payable under our revolving credit facility is not reflected in the above table because such amounts depend on the outstanding balances and interest rates, which vary from time to time.\nLetter of Credit. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding irrevocable letters of credit in the amount of $16.7 million, which were issued under our revolving credit facility.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nDescription of Our Indebtedness\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAt December 31, 2020, we maintained a $300.0 million revolving credit facility which matures on August 31, 2023. On July 8, 2020, the Partnership amended its revolving credit facility to, among other things, permit the Exchange Offer. Please see Note 16 in Part II of this Form 10-K for more information about the July 8, 2020 amendment to our revolving credit facility (\"the Credit Facility Amendment\")..\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $148.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $16.7 million of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit, leaving a maximum available to be borrowed under our credit facility for future revolving credit borrowings and letters of credit of $135.3 million. After giving effect to our then current borrowings, outstanding letters of credit and the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility, we had the ability to borrow approximately $20.5 million in additional amounts thereunder as of December 31, 2020.\nThe revolving credit facility is used for ongoing working capital needs and general partnership purposes, and to finance permitted investments, acquisitions and capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility has ranged from a low of $148.0 million to a high of $223.0 million.\nThe credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Obligations under the credit facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our assets and those of the guarantors, including, without limitation, inventory, accounts receivable, bank accounts, marine vessels, equipment, fixed assets and the interests in our subsidiaries.\nWe may prepay all amounts outstanding under the credit facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs), subject to certain notice requirements. The credit facility requires mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding thereunder with excess cash that exceeds $25.0 million and the net proceeds of certain asset sales, equity issuances and debt incurrences. If we sell assets and receive net cash proceeds in excess of $25.0 million, the commitments of the lenders under the revolving credit facility will be reduced by $25.0 million.\nIndebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at our option at the Eurodollar Rate (LIBOR), with a floor for LIBOR of 1%, plus an applicable margin, or the Base Rate (the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, the 30-day\nEurodollar Rate plus 1.0%, or the administrative agent\u2019s prime rate) plus an applicable margin. We pay a per annum fee on all letters of credit issued under the credit facility, and we pay a commitment fee per annum on the unused revolving credit commitments under the credit facility. The letter of credit fee, the commitment fee and the applicable margins for our interest rate vary quarterly based on our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility Amendment, being generally computed as the ratio of total funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash charges) and are as follows as of December 31, 2020:\nThe applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings at December 31, 2020 is 3.75%, with a 1% floor for LIBOR.\nThe credit facility includes financial covenants that are tested on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nIn addition, the credit facility contains various covenants, which, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to: (i) grant or assume liens; (ii) make investments (including investments in our joint ventures) and acquisitions; (iii) enter into certain types of hedging agreements; (iv) incur or assume indebtedness; (v) sell, transfer, assign or convey assets; (vi) repurchase our equity, make distributions (including a limit on our ability to make quarterly distributions to unitholders in excess of $0.005 per unit unless our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility Amendment) is below 3.75:1:00) and certain other restricted payments; (vii) change the nature of our business; (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into certain burdensome agreements; (x) make certain amendments to the Omnibus Agreement and our material agreements; and (xi) permit our joint ventures to incur indebtedness or grant certain liens.\nThe credit facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation: (i) failure to pay any principal, interest, fees, expenses or other amounts when due; (ii) failure to meet the quarterly financial covenants; (iii) failure to observe any other agreement, obligation, or covenant in the credit facility or any related loan document, subject to cure periods for certain failures; (iv) the failure of any representation or warranty to be materially true and correct when made; (v) our, or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 default under other indebtedness that exceeds a threshold amount; (vi) bankruptcy or other insolvency events involving us or any of our subsidiaries; (vii) judgments against us or any of our subsidiaries, in excess of a threshold amount; (viii) certain ERISA events involving us or any of our subsidiaries, in excess of a threshold amount; (ix) a change in control (as defined in the credit facility); and (x) the invalidity of any of the loan documents or the failure of any of the collateral documents to create a lien on the collateral.\nThe credit facility also contains certain default provisions relating to Martin Resource Management Corporation. If Martin Resource Management Corporation no longer controls our general partner, the lenders under the credit facility may declare all amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable. In addition, an event of default by Martin Resource Management Corporation under its credit facility could independently result in an event of default under our credit facility if it is deemed to have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events occurs with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries, all indebtedness under our credit facility will immediately become due and payable. If any other event of default exists under our credit facility, the lenders may terminate their commitments to lend us money, accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility and exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if any event of default exists under our credit facility, the lenders may commence foreclosure or other actions against the collateral.\n2025 Senior Secured Notes and Indenture\nGeneral\nPursuant to the Exchange Offer, we and Martin Midstream Finance Corp., our wholly owned subsidiary (collectively the \"Issuers\") issued $292.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Issuers\u2019 11.50% senior secured second lien notes due 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\"), the 2025 Notes were issued to eligible holders that participated in the Exchange Offer pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 12, 2020 (the \"2025 Notes Indenture\"), among the Issuers, the guarantors party thereto, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and U.S. Bank National Association as collateral trustee.\nThe 2025 Notes are guaranteed on a full, joint and several basis by each of the Partnership\u2019s existing domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than Martin Midstream Finance Corp. and Talen\u2019s Marine & Fuel, LLC) and will be guaranteed in the future by any domestic restricted subsidiaries, in each case, if and so long as such entity guarantees (or is an obligor with respect to) any other indebtedness for borrowed money of either the Issuers or any guarantor. The 2025 Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured on a third-priority basis by a lien on substantially all assets of the Issuers and the guarantors, subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement (the \"Intercreditor Agreement\") and certain other exceptions.\nThe 2025 Notes and the guarantees thereof are, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, secured by third-priority liens and thus are effectively junior to any obligations under our credit facility, which are secured on a \"first-lien\" basis, and effectively junior to any obligations under the 2024 Notes Indenture (as defined below), which are secured on a \"second-lien\" basis, in each case, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such first-lien obligations, second-lien obligations and third-lien obligations. The 2025 Notes and the guarantees thereof rank effectively senior to all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2025 Notes and such guarantees.\nMaturity and Interest\nThe 2025 Notes will mature on February 28, 2025. Interest on the 2025 Notes accrues at a rate of 11.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2021.\nRedemption\nAt any time prior to August 12, 2022, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes issued under the 2025 Notes Indenture at a redemption price of 111.5% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with an amount of cash equal to the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. On or after August 12, 2022, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the 2025 Notes at redemption prices equal to 100%, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to August 12, 2022, the Issuers may redeem all or a part of the 2025 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date.\nAlso, if at the end of any fiscal year (commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021) the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility Amendment) is greater than 3.75:1:00, the Issuers will use 25% of any excess annual cash flow (as defined in the 2025 Notes Indenture) to make an offer to all holders of the 2025 Notes to purchase the 2025 Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof; provided, however, the Issuers, in their sole discretion, can allocate up to 100% of excess cash flow to offer to repurchase the 2025 Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, subject to restrictions in the revolving credit facility on prepaying junior debt.\nCertain Covenants and Events of Default\nThe 2025 Notes Indenture contains customary covenants restricting the Partnership\u2019s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay distributions on, purchase or redeem its common units or purchase or redeem its subordinated debt; (ii) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain kinds of preferred equity securities; (iii) create or incur certain liens securing indebtedness; (iv) sell assets, including dispositions of the collateral securing the 2025 Notes; (v) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (vii) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from its restricted subsidiaries to the Partnership. The 2025 Notes Indenture also contains customary events of default and acceleration provisions relating to such events of default, which provide that upon an event of default under the 2025 Notes Indenture, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 2025 Notes may declare all of the 2025 Notes to be due\nand payable immediately and, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, foreclose upon the collateral for the 2025 Notes.\n2024 Senior Secured Notes and Indenture\nGeneral\nPursuant to the rights offering in connection with the Exchange Offer, the Issuers issued $53.8 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers\u2019 10.00% senior secured 1.5 lien notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\"). The 2024 Notes were issued to eligible holders that participated in the Exchange Offer pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 12, 2020 (the \"2024 Notes Indenture\"), among the Issuers, the guarantors party thereto, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and U.S. Bank National Association as collateral trustee.\nThe 2024 Notes are guaranteed on a full, joint and several basis by the guarantors of the 2025 Notes and will be guaranteed in the future by any domestic restricted subsidiaries, in each case, if and so long as such entity guarantees (or is an obligor with respect to) any other indebtedness for borrowed money of either the Issuers or any guarantor. The 2024 Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured on a second-priority basis by a lien on substantially all assets of the Issuers and the guarantors, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and certain other exceptions.\nThe 2024 Notes and the guarantees thereof are, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, secured by second-priority liens and thus are effectively junior to any obligations under the Credit Facility, which are secured on a \"first-lien\" basis, and are effectively senior to the obligations under the 2025 Notes Indenture, which are secured on a \"third-lien\" basis, in each case, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such first-lien, second-lien obligations and third-lien obligations. The 2024 Notes and the guarantees thereof rank effectively senior to all of the Issuers\u2019 existing and future unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2024 Notes and such guarantees.\nMaturity and Interest\nThe 2024 Notes will mature on February 29, 2024. Interest on the 2024 Notes accrues at a rate of 10.00% per annum and is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2021.\nRedemption\nAt any time prior to August 12, 2021, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes issued under the 2024 Notes Indenture at a redemption price of 110% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with an amount of cash equal to the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. On or after August 12, 2021, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the 2024 Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount) equal to (i) 102% for the twelve-month period beginning on August 12, 2021; (ii) 101% for the twelve-month period beginning on August 12, 2022 and (iii) 100% at any time thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to August 12, 2021, the Issuers may redeem all or a part of the 2024 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date.\nCertain Covenants and Events of Default\nThe 2024 Notes Indenture contains covenants that are substantially the same as those contained in the 2025 Notes Indenture described above.\n2021 Senior Notes and Indenture\nThe Issuers entered into an Indenture, dated as of February 11, 2013. among the Issuers, certain subsidiary guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, under which the Issuers issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of their 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\"). In 2015, we repurchased on the open market and subsequently retired an aggregate $26.2 million of our outstanding 2021 Notes. In 2020, we repurchased on the open market and subsequently retired an aggregate $9.3 million of our outstanding 2021 Notes. On August 12, 2020, we completed the Exchange Offer and Cash Tender Offer. In connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer and consent solicitation to certain eligible holders of the 2021 Notes, on August 12, 2020, we entered into a supplemental indenture to eliminate\nsubstantially all of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. On February 15, 2021, our 2021 Notes matured and we retired the outstanding balance of $28.8 million using proceeds from our revolving credit facility.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nHistorically, we have generally satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our debt service obligations and capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.0 million and available borrowing capacity of $20.5 million under our revolving credit facility with $148.0 million of borrowings outstanding. Our revolving credit facility matures on August 31, 2023.\nWe expect that our primary sources of liquidity to meet operating expenses, service our indebtedness, pay distributions to our unitholders and fund capital expenditures will be provided by cash flows generated by our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to the debt and equity capital markets. Our ability to generate cash from operations will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to certain risks. For a discussion of such risks, please read \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K. In addition, due to the covenants in our revolving credit facility, our financial and operating performance impacts the amount we are permitted to borrow under that facility.\nThe Partnership is in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2020 and expects to be in compliance for the next twelve months.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our credit facility due to the variable interest rate and may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce this variable rate risk.\nSeasonality\nA substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on sales prices of products, particularly NGLs and fertilizers, which fluctuate in part based on winter and spring weather conditions. The demand for NGLs is strongest during the winter heating season and the refinery blending season. The demand for fertilizers is strongest during the early spring planting season. However, our Terminalling and Storage and Transportation business segments and the molten sulfur business are typically not impacted by seasonal fluctuations and a significant portion of our net income is derived from our Terminalling and Storage, Sulfur Services and Transportation business segments. Further, extraordinary weather events, such as hurricanes, have in the past, and could in the future, impact our Terminalling and Storage, Sulfur Services, and Transportation business segments.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2020, 2019 or 2018. Although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it is still a factor in the U.S. economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property, plant and equipment. It may also increase the costs of labor and supplies. In the future, increasing energy prices could adversely affect our results of operations. Diesel fuel, natural gas, chemicals and other supplies are recorded in operating expenses. An increase in price of these products would increase our operating expenses which could adversely affect net income. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to pass along increased operating expenses to our customers.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted. We incurred no material environmental costs, liabilities or expenditures to mitigate or eliminate environmental contamination during 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nItem 7A.",
    "section_7A": "Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nCommodity Risk. The Partnership from time to time uses derivatives to manage the risk of commodity price fluctuation. Commodity risk is the adverse effect on the value of a liability or future purchase that results from a change in commodity price. We have established a hedging policy and monitor and manage the commodity market risk associated with potential commodity risk exposure. In addition, we focus on utilizing counterparties for these transactions whose financial condition is appropriate for the credit risk involved in each specific transaction.\nWe have entered into hedging transactions as of December 31, 2020 to mitigate a portion of our commodity price risk exposure. These hedging arrangements are in the form of swaps for NGLs. We have instruments totaling a gross notional quantity of 137,000 barrels settling during the period from January 31, 2021 through February 28, 2021. These instruments settle against the applicable pricing source for each grade and location. These instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020 in \"Fair value of derivatives\" as a current liability of $0.2 million. Based on the current net notional volume hedged as of December 31, 2020, a $0.10 change in the expected settlement price of these contracts would result in an impact of $0.6 million to the Partnership's net income.\nInterest Rate Risk. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates and include a LIBOR floor of 1.00%. Our revolving credit facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.75% as of December 31, 2020. Based on the amount of unhedged floating rate debt owed by us on December 31, 2020, the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately $0.2 million annually.\nWe are not exposed to changes in interest rates with respect to our 2021 Notes, 2024 Notes and 2025 Notes as these obligations are fixed rate. Based on the quoted prices for identical liabilities in markets that are not active at December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes, 2024 Notes and 2025 Notes was $28.6 million, $55.2 million and $288.7 million, respectively. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Such an increase in interest rates at December 31, 2020 would result in a $0.5 million decrease in the fair value of our 2021 Notes, a $0.9 million decrease in the fair value of our 2024 Notes, and a $5.0 million decrease in the fair value of our 2025 Notes. On February 15, 2021, our 2021 Notes matured and we retired the outstanding balance of $28.8 million using our revolving credit facility.\nItem 8.",
    "section_8": "Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe following financial statements of Martin Midstream Partners L.P. (Partnership) are listed below:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Unitholders and Board of Directors\nMartin Midstream Partners L.P. and Martin Midstream GP LLC:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Martin Midstream Partners L.P. and subsidiaries (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in capital (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership has changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of goodwill for the terminalling and storage reporting unit\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill balance as of December 31, 2020 was $16,823 thousand, of which $10,985 thousand related to the terminalling and storage reporting unit. The Partnership performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. During the first quarter of 2020, the Partnership determined that triggering events, including declines in the market price of its units and the economic downturn, required an evaluation of goodwill at March 31, 2020. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a combination of income and market approach methods. The Partnership determined that goodwill was not impaired based on both its interim and annual evaluations.\nWe identified the evaluation of the goodwill impairment assessments for the terminalling and storage reporting unit as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment was required to evaluate the discounted cash flow projections used in the determinations of fair value, specifically assumptions related to forecasted revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and the discount rates. These assumptions were challenging to test as the estimated fair values of the terminalling and storage reporting unit were sensitive to possible changes to such assumptions. The audit effort to evaluate the discount rates used in the income approaches and the market multiples used in the market approaches required specialized skills and knowledge.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the Partnership\u2019s forecasted revenues and EBITDA by comparing them to historical results and analyst reports, considering the portion of revenues and EBITDA projections supported by long-term, fixed fee contracts and the portion impacted by current market conditions. We compared historical forecasts of revenues and EBITDA to actual results to assess the Company\u2019s ability to estimate such amounts. We performed sensitivity analyses over forecasted revenues and EBITDA and the discount rates to assess their impact on the Partnership\u2019s determinations of the fair value of the reporting unit.\nIn addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n-evaluating the discount rates used in the terminalling and storage reporting unit\u2019s discounted cash flow models, by comparing them against discount rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities\n-evaluating the market multiples used within the guideline public company methods, by developing independent calculations of the guideline comparable companies\u2019 multiples using publicly available market data\n-evaluating the market multiples used within the guideline transaction methods, by comparing against independent transaction searches of publicly available market data from the previous two years\n-evaluating the control premiums implied in reconciling the sum of the fair values of the individual reporting units with the Partnership\u2019s market capitalizations, by comparing against implied control premiums based on publicly available market data.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Partnership\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 3, 2021\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Dollars in thousands, except per unit amounts)\n*Related Party Transactions Shown Below\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n1 Financial information has been revised to include results attributable to MTI acquired from Martin Resource Management Corporation.

ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nMartin Midstream Partners L.P. (the \"Partnership\") is a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the United States (\"U.S.\") Gulf Coast region. Its four primary business lines include: terminalling, processing, storage and packaging services for petroleum products and by-products including the refining of naphthenic crude oil; land and marine transportation services for petroleum products and by-products, chemicals, and specialty products; sulfur and sulfur-based products processing, manufacturing, marketing and distribution; and NGL marketing, distribution, and transportation services.\nThe Partnership provides specialty services to major and independent oil and gas companies, independent refiners, large chemical companies, and other wholesale purchasers of certain petroleum products and by-products, with significant business concentrated around the U.S. Gulf Coast refinery complex, which is a major hub for petroleum refining, natural gas gathering and processing, and support services for the exploration and production industry. The petroleum products and by-products the Partnership gathers, transports, stores and markets are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas companies who often rely on third parties, such as the Partnership, for the transportation and disposition of these products.\nOn August 30, 2013, Martin Resource Management Corporation completed the sale of a 49% non-controlling voting interest (50% economic interest) in MMGP Holdings, LLC (\"Holdings\"), a newly-formed sole member of Martin Midstream GP LLC (\"MMGP\"), the general partner of the Partnership, to certain affiliated investment funds managed by Alinda Capital Partners (\"Alinda\"). Upon closing the transaction, Alinda appointed two representatives to serve on the board of directors of the general partner of the Partnership.\nNOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES\n(a) Principles of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and equity method investees. In the opinion of the management of the Partnership\u2019s general partner, all adjustments and elimination of significant intercompany balances necessary for a fair presentation of the Partnership\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods shown have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. In addition, the Partnership evaluates its relationships with other entities to identify whether they are variable interest entities under certain provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"), 810-10 and to assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of such entities. If the determination is made that the Partnership is the primary beneficiary, then that entity is included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC 810-10. No such variable interest entities exist as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic. Due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the markets experienced a decline in oil prices in response to oil demand concerns. These concerns were further exacerbated by the price war among members OPEC and other non-OPEC producer nations during the first quarter of 2020 and global storage considerations. Travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders implemented by governments in many regions and countries across the globe, including the United States, have greatly impacted the demand for refined products resulting in a significant reduction in refinery utilization, which has impacted the Partnership's 2020 performance. This impact started in February of 2020 and continued through the end of the year, during which time the Partnership has seen unfavorable trends in certain key metrics across several of its business lines compared to historical periods. The significant reduction in refinery utilization as a result of reduced refined products demand significantly impacted the Partnership's Transportation and NGL segments. As the volume of products produced or purchased by refineries has been reduced, demand for the Partnership's services has decreased.\nLooking forward, we expect to continue to experience some adverse impacts of COVID-19 in our transportation segment during the first half of 2021 but we believe that refinery utilization will continue to increase in the second half of 2021 as a result of widespread vaccinations, government stimulus, and a rebounding economy. This should ultimately improve refined product demand as people get back to work and begin traveling again. We expect this will positively impact our transportation segment as demand for our services improves.\nOverall, the extent to which the duration and severity of the pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nAccordingly, it is possible that the impact of the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 including the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, the valuation of inventory, and the amount of expected credit losses.\nManagement considered the impact of the pandemic on the assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. Management identified triggering events requiring the performance of impairment testing of long-lived assets and goodwill related to both the performance of the Partnership's unit price during the first quarter of 2020 and certain of the Partnership's businesses that are sensitive to reductions in refined product demand and refinery utilization. As a result, the Partnership recorded impairment charges totaling $4,352 related to long-lived assets during the first quarter of 2020. See Note 5 for more information. No impairments were identified related to goodwill. A sustained reduction in refinery demand and utilization could lead to future asset impairments as well as adversely affect access to capital and financing to be able to meet future obligations. Management also assessed the extent to which the current macroeconomic events brought about by the pandemic and significant declines in refined product demand impacted the valuation of expected credit losses on accounts receivable and certain inventory items or resulted in modifications to any significant contracts. Ultimately the results of these assessments did not have a material impact on the Partnership's results as of December 31, 2020.\nDivestiture of Natural Gas Storage Assets. On June 28, 2019, the Partnership completed the sale of its membership interests in Arcadia Gas Storage, LLC, Cadeville Gas Storage LLC, Monroe Gas Storage Company, LLC and Perryville Gas Storage LLC (the \"Natural Gas Storage Assets\") to Hartree Cardinal Gas, LLC (\"Hartree\"), a subsidiary of Hartree Bulk Storage, LLC. The Natural Gas Storage Assets consist of approximately 50 billion cubic feet of working capacity located in northern Louisiana and Mississippi. In consideration of the sale of the Natural Gas Storage Assets, the Partnership received cash proceeds of $210,067 after transaction fees and expenses. The net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility. The Partnership concluded the disposition represents a strategic shift and will have a major effect on its financial results going forward. As a result, the Partnership has presented the results of operations and cash flows relating to the Natural Gas Storage Assets as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 5 for more information.\nAcquisition of Martin Transport, Inc. On January 2, 2019, the Partnership acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of MTI from Martin Resource Management Corporation. MTI operates a fleet of trucks providing transportation of petroleum products, liquid petroleum gas, chemicals, sulfur and other products, as well as owns 23 terminals located throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast and Southeastern United States.\nThe acquisition of MTI was considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control. As a result, the acquisition of MTI was recorded at amounts based on the historical carrying value of these assets at January 1, 2019, and the Partnership is required to update its historical financial statements to include the activities of MTI as of the date of common control. See Note 4 for more information. The Partnership\u2019s accompanying historical financial statements have been retrospectively updated to reflect the effects on financial position, cash flows and results of operations attributable to the activities of MTI as if the Partnership owned these assets for the periods presented. See Note 4 for separate results of MTI for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net income attributable to MTI for periods prior to the Partnership\u2019s acquisition of the assets is not allocated to the limited partners for purposes of calculating net income per limited partner unit. See Note 17.\nDivestiture of WTLPG Partnership Interest. On July 31, 2018, the Partnership completed the sale of its 20 percent non-operating interest in West Texas LPG Pipeline L.P. (\"WTLPG\") to ONEOK, Inc. (\"ONEOK\"). WTLPG owns an approximate 2,300 mile common-carrier pipeline system that primarily transports NGLs from New Mexico and Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation. A wholly-owned subsidiary of ONEOK, Inc. is the operator of the assets. The Partnership concluded the disposition represents a strategic shift and will have a major effect on its financial results going forward. As a result, the Partnership has presented the results of operations and cash flows relating to its equity method investment in WTLPG as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 5 for more information.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\n(b) Product Exchanges\nThe Partnership enters into product exchange agreements with third parties, whereby the Partnership agrees to exchange NGLs and sulfur with third parties. The Partnership records the balance of exchange products due to other companies under these agreements at quoted market product prices and the balance of exchange products due from other companies at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. Product exchanges with the same counterparty are entered into in contemplation of one another and are combined. The net amount related to location differentials is reported in \"Product sales\" or \"Cost of products sold\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(c) Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is generally determined by using the FIFO method for all inventories except lubricants and lubricants packaging inventories. Lubricants and lubricants packaging inventories cost is determined using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, computed on a FIFO basis.\n(d) Revenue Recognition\nTerminalling and Storage - Revenue is recognized for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee. For throughput contracts, revenue is recognized based on the volume moved through the Partnership\u2019s terminals at the contracted rate. For the Partnership\u2019s tolling agreement, revenue is recognized based on the contracted monthly reservation fee and throughput volumes moved through the facility. When lubricants and drilling fluids are sold by truck or rail, revenue is recognized when title is transferred, which is either upon delivering product to the customer or when the product leaves the Partnership's facility, depending on the specific terms of the contract. Delivery of product is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nTransportation - Revenue related to land transportation is recognized for line hauls based on a mileage rate. For contracted trips, revenue is recognized upon completion of the particular trip. The performance of the service is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month. Revenue related to marine transportation is recognized for time charters based on a per day rate. For contracted trips, revenue is recognized upon completion of the particular trip. The performance of the service is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nSulfur Services - Revenue from sulfur and fertilizer product sales is recognized when the customer takes title to the product. Delivery of product is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month. Revenue from sulfur services is recognized as services are performed during each monthly period. The performance of the service is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nNatural Gas Liquids - NGL distribution revenue is recognized when product is delivered by truck, rail, or pipeline to the Partnership's NGL customers. Revenue is recognized on title transfer of the product to the customer. Delivery of product is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\n(e) Equity Method Investments\nThe Partnership uses the equity method of accounting for investments in unconsolidated entities where the ability to exercise significant influence over such entities exists. Investments in unconsolidated entities consist of capital contributions and advances plus the Partnership\u2019s share of accumulated earnings as of the entities\u2019 latest fiscal year-ends, less capital withdrawals and distributions. Equity method investments are subject to impairment under the provisions of ASC 323-10, which relates to the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock. No portion of the net income from these entities is included in the Partnership\u2019s operating income.\n(f) Property, Plant, and Equipment\nOwned property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Owned buildings and equipment are depreciated using straight-line method over the estimated lives of the respective assets.\nEquipment under finance leases is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments less accumulated amortization. Equipment under finance leases is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nRoutine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense while costs of betterments and renewals are capitalized. When an asset is retired or sold, its cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the difference between net book value of the asset and proceeds from disposition is recognized as gain or loss.\n(g) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is subject to a fair-value based impairment test on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. The Partnership is required to identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets. The Partnership is required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. To the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Partnership will record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nWhen assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, the Partnership may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. After assessing qualitative factors, if the Partnership determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative assessment is not required. If an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other intangible asset, a quantitative analysis will be performed. The Partnership may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances.\nOf the Partnership's four reporting units, the terminalling and storage, transportation, and sulfur services reporting units contain goodwill. No goodwill impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nIn performing a quantitative analysis, recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a weighting of the discounted cash flow method and two market approaches (the guideline public company method and the guideline transaction method). The discounted cash flow model incorporates discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\"). The WACC considers market and industry data as well as company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Management, considering industry and company specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount, the Partnership will record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nSignificant changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could give rise to future impairment. Changes to these estimates and assumptions can include, but may not be limited to, varying commodity prices, volume changes and operating costs due to market conditions and/or alternative providers of services.\nApplying this impairment review methodology, the Partnership considered the impact that COVID-19 had on our cash flows and the value our unit price during 2020 and elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment. Based upon the most recent annual review as of August 31, 2020, no goodwill impairment exists within the Partnership's reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2020. No goodwill impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nOther intangible assets that have finite lives are tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived intangible asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the Partnership would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. There were no intangible asset impairments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\n(h) Debt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs relating to the Partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility and senior notes are deferred and amortized over the terms of the debt arrangements and are shown, net of accumulated amortization, as a reduction of the related long-term debt.\nIn connection with the issuance, amendment, expansion and restatement of debt arrangements, the Partnership incurred debt issuance costs of $3,781, $4,406 and $1,312 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAmortization and write-off of debt issuance costs, which is included in interest expense, totaled $3,422, $4,041 and $3,445 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Accumulated amortization amounted to $22,655 and $24,644 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(i) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360-10, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.\n(j) Asset Retirement Obligations\nUnder ASC 410-20, which relates to accounting requirements for costs associated with legal obligations to retire tangible, long-lived assets, the Partnership records an asset retirement obligation (\"ARO\") at fair value in the period in which it is incurred by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. In each subsequent period, the liability is accreted over time towards the ultimate obligation amount and the capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.\n(k) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn accordance with certain provisions of ASC 815-10 related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, all derivatives and hedging instruments are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an asset or liability measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value can be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nDerivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked to market with all market value adjustments being recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(l) Use of Estimates\nManagement has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\n(m) Environmental Liabilities and Litigation\nThe Partnership\u2019s policy is to accrue for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.\n(n) Trade and Accrued Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Partnership\u2019s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Partnership\u2019s existing accounts receivable.\n(o) Deferred Catalyst Costs\nThe cost of the periodic replacement of catalysts is deferred and amortized over the catalyst\u2019s estimated useful life, which ranges from 12 to 36 months.\n(p) Deferred Turnaround Costs\nThe Partnership capitalizes the cost of major turnarounds and amortizes these costs over the estimated period to the next turnaround, which ranges from 12 to 36 months.\n(q) Income Taxes\nThe Partnership is subject to the Texas margin tax, which is considered a state income tax, and is included in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Since the tax base on the Texas margin tax is derived from an income-based measure, the margin tax is construed as an income tax and, therefore, the recognition of deferred taxes applies to the margin tax. The impact on deferred taxes as a result of this provision is immaterial.\nMTI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership. Prior to the acquisition of MTI on January 2, 2019, MTI was a Qualified Subchapter S subsidiary (\u201cQSub\u201d) of Martin Resource Management Corporation, a qualifying S Corporation. A QSub is not treated as a separate corporation for federal income tax purposes as it is deemed liquidated into its S Corporation parent. S Corporations are generally not subject to income taxes because income and losses flow through to shareholders and are reported on their individual returns. Three states in which MTI was subject to taxation prior to the acquisition - Louisiana, New Jersey and Tennessee - do not recognize the federal S Corporation status and, therefore, taxed MTI on a C Corporation basis. Subsequent to the acquisition, the QSub election terminated resulting in MTI being taxed as a stand-alone C Corporation.\nThe Partnership's financial statements recognize the current and deferred income tax consequences that result from MTI\u2019s activities during the current period pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740 related to income taxes. As a result of the common control transaction with the Partnership, the deferred tax consequences of the changes in the tax bases of MTI\u2019s assets and liabilities were included in equity under the provisions of ASC 740-20-45-11.\nWith respect to the Partnership\u2019s taxable subsidiary (MTI), income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nIn the ordinary course of business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, we use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nexpected to be taken in a tax return. In the first step, \u201crecognition\u201d, the Partnership determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Partnership presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In the second step, \u201cmeasurement\u201d, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement based upon management\u2019s intent regarding negotiation and litigation. In evaluating all income tax positions for all open years, management has determined all positions are more likely than not to be sustained at full benefit based upon their technical merit under applicable tax laws.\n(r) Comprehensive Income\nComprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income. There are no items of other comprehensive income or loss in any of the years presented.\nNOTE 3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn December 2019, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which removes certain exceptions to general principles in ASC 740 and clarifies and amends existing guidance within US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). The standard is effective for the Partnership\u2019s financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Partnership will adopt this ASU beginning January 1, 2021 and plans to use the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded through retained earnings, for hybrid tax regimes. All other applicable amendments will be applied on a prospective basis. The result of this adoption will have no material impact on the Partnership\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Partnership adopted ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,\" which required the Partnership to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaced the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets, including trade receivables. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Partnership\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which will expand the scope of FASB ASC 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. The standard is effective for the Partnership's financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Partnership adopted this standard effective January 1, 2019. The result of this adoption did not have a material impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. Lessor accounting under the new standard is substantially unchanged and substantially all of our leases will continue to be classified as operating leases under the new standard. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management are required. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The original guidance required application on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to FASB ASC 842, which includes an option to not restate comparative periods in transition and elect to use the effective date of ASC 842, Leases, as the date of initial application of transition. The Partnership adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019, electing the transition option provided under ASU 2018-11. Consequently, financial information was not updated and the disclosures required under the new standard are not provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.\nThe new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Partnership elected the \"package of practical expedients\", which permits the Partnership not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity\u2019s ongoing accounting. The Partnership elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nThis means, for those assets that qualify, the Partnership did not recognize Right-of-Use (\"ROU\") assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. See Note 10 for more information.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The new standard was effective for the Partnership on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Partnership adopted the new standard utilizing the cumulative effect method which resulted in no cumulative effect of the adoption being recorded as of January 1, 2018. The Partnership did not identify any significant changes in the timing of revenue recognition when considering the amended accounting guidance. Additional disclosures related to revenue recognition appear in \"Note 6. Revenue.\"\nNOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS\nMartin Transport, Inc. Stock Purchase Agreement. On January 2, 2019, the Partnership acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of MTI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Martin Resource Management Corporation which operates a fleet of trucks providing transportation of petroleum products, liquid petroleum gas, chemicals, sulfur and other products, as well as owns 23 terminals located throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast and Southeastern United States for total consideration as follows:\n1The stock purchase agreement also includes a $10,000 earn-out based on certain performance thresholds. The performance threshold related to financial results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was not achieved, which resulted in a reduction in the potential earn-out by $6,666.\nThe transaction closed on January 2, 2019 and was effective as of January 1, 2019 and was funded with borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility.\nThis acquisition is considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control. The acquisition of MTI was recorded at the historical carrying value of the assets at the acquisition date, which were as follows:\nThe excess purchase price over the historical carrying value of the assets at the acquisition date was $102,393 and was recorded as an adjustment to \"Partners' capital (deficit)\".\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nThe separate results of operations related to MTI for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was recast as part of the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Operations, were as follows:\nNOTE 5. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE\nDivestitures\nDivestiture of Mega Lubricants. On December 22, 2020, the Partnership completed the sale of Mega Lubricants for $22,400. Mega Lubricants is engaged in the business of blending, manufacturing and delivering various marine application lubricants, sub-sea specialty fluids, and proprietary developed commercial and industrial products. The Partnership recorded a gain on the disposition of $10,101, which was included in \"Other operating income, net\" on the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility. The divestiture of Mega Lubricants did not qualify for discontinued operations presentation under the guidance of ASC 205-20.\nDivestiture of East Texas Pipeline. On August 12, 2019, the Partnership completed the sale of its East Texas Pipeline for $17,500. The Partnership recorded a gain on the disposition of $16,154, which was included in \"Other operating income, net\" on the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility. The divestiture of the East Texas Pipeline assets did not qualify for discontinued operations presentation under the guidance of ASC 205-20.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nDivestiture of Natural Gas Storage Assets. On June 28, 2019, the Partnership completed the sale of the Natural Gas Storage Assets to Hartree, a subsidiary of Hartree Bulk Storage, LLC. The Natural Gas Storage Assets consist of approximately 50 billion cubic feet of working capacity located in northern Louisiana and Mississippi. In consideration of the sale of these assets, the Partnership received cash proceeds of $210,067 after transaction fees and expenses. The net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility. The Partnership concluded the disposition represents a strategic shift and will have a major effect on its financial results going forward. As a result, the Partnership has presented the results of operations and cash flows relating to the Natural Gas Storage Assets as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe operating results, which are included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, were as follows:\n1 The year ended December 31, 2019 includes a loss on the disposition of the Natural Gas Storage Assets of $178,781.\nDivestiture of WTLPG Partnership Interest. On July 31, 2018, the Partnership completed the sale of its 20 percent non-operating interest in WTLPG to ONEOK. WTLPG owns an approximate 2,300 mile common-carrier pipeline system that primarily transports NGLs from New Mexico and Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation. A wholly-owned subsidiary of ONEOK is the operator of the assets. In consideration for the sale of these assets, the Partnership received cash proceeds of $193,705, after transaction fees and expenses. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility. The Partnership concluded the disposition represents a strategic shift and will have a major effect on its financial results going forward. As a result, the Partnership has presented the results of operations and cash flows relating to its equity method investment in WTLPG as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe operating results, which are included in income from discontinued operations, were as follows:\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\n1 These expenses represent direct operating expenses as a result of the Partnership's ownership interest in WTLPG.\n2 Other operating income represents the gain on the disposition of the investment in WTLPG.\nLong-Lived Assets Held for Sale\nAt December 31, 2019, certain terminalling and storage and transportation assets met the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with ASC 360-10 and are presented at the lower of the assets' carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell by segment in current assets in the table below. These assets are considered non-core assets to the Partnership's operations and did not qualify for discontinued operations presentation under the guidance of ASC 205-20.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Partnership identified a triggering event related to a decline in the fair value related to the assets classified as held for sale at December 31, 2019. As a result, an impairment charge of $3,052 and $1,300 was recorded in the Terminalling and Storage and Transportation segments, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020 and was recorded in \"Other operating income (loss)\" in the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2020, the remaining assets previously classified as held for sale in the amount of $700 no longer met the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with ASC 360-10.\nThe non-core assets discussed above did not qualify for discontinued operations presentation under the guidance of ASC 205-20.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nNOTE 6. REVENUE\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source:\nRevenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties where the Partnership is acting as an agent. The Partnership recognizes revenue when the Partnership satisfies a performance obligation, which typically occurs when the Partnership transfers control over a product to a customer or as the Partnership delivers a service.\nThe following is a description of the principal activities - separated by reportable segments - from which the Partnership generates revenue.\nTerminalling and Storage Segment\nRevenue is recognized for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee. For throughput contracts, revenue is recognized based on the volume moved through the Partnership\u2019s terminals at the contracted rate. For the Partnership\u2019s tolling agreement, revenue is recognized based on the contracted monthly reservation fee and throughput volumes moved through the facility. When lubricants and drilling fluids are sold by truck or rail, revenue is recognized when title is transferred, which is either upon delivering product to the customer or when the product leaves the Partnership's facility, depending on the specific terms of the contract. Delivery of product is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month. Throughput and storage revenue in the table above includes non-cancelable revenue arrangements that are under the scope of ASC 842, whereby the Partnership has committed certain Terminalling and Storage assets in exchange for a minimum fee.\nNatural Gas Liquids Segment\nNatural Gas Liquids (\"NGL\") distribution revenue is recognized when product is delivered by truck, rail, or pipeline to the Partnership's NGL customers. Revenue is recognized on title transfer of the product to the customer. Delivery of product is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSulfur Services Segment\nRevenue from sulfur and fertilizer product sales is recognized when the customer takes title to the product. Delivery of product is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month. Revenue from sulfur services is recognized as services are performed during each monthly period. The performance of the service is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nTransportation Segment\nRevenue related to land transportation is recognized for line hauls based on a mileage rate. For contracted trips, revenue is recognized upon completion of the particular trip. The performance of the service is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nRevenue related to marine transportation is recognized for time charters based on a per day rate. For contracted trips, revenue is recognized upon completion of the particular trip. The performance of the service is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nThe table below includes estimated minimum revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. The Partnership applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.\nNOTE 7. INVENTORIES\nComponents of inventories at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nNOTE 8. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, property, plant and equipment consisted of the following:\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $55,817, $53,856 and $58,615, respectively, which includes amortization of fixed assets acquired under capital lease obligations of $1,755, $2,686, and $1,174. Gross assets under capital leases were $10,352 and $15,367 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accumulated amortization associated with capital leases was $3,703 and $3,941 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment included in accounts payable at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $468, $3,791, and $2,166, respectively. Equipment purchased under capital lease obligations was $83, $1,308, and $10,472 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nNOTE 9. GOODWILL\nThe following table represents the goodwill balance by reporting unit at December 31, 2020 and 2019 as follows:\n1 This change represents goodwill disposed of as part of the Partnership's divestiture of Mega Lubricants. See Note 5 for more information.\nNOTE 10. LEASES\nThe Partnership has numerous operating leases primarily for terminal facilities and transportation and other equipment. The leases generally provide that all expenses related to the equipment are to be paid by the lessee.\nOperating lease Right-of-Use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of the Partnership's leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, the Partnership uses its imputed collateralized rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The estimated rate is based on a risk-free rate plus a risk-adjusted margin.\nOur leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 16 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. The Partnership includes extension periods and excludes termination periods from its lease term if, at commencement, it is reasonably likely that the Partnership will exercise the option.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nThe components of lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to leases were as follows:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nThe Partnership\u2019s future minimum lease obligations as of December 31, 2020 consist of the following:\nThe Partnership has non-cancelable revenue arrangements that are under the scope of ASC 842 whereby we have committed certain terminalling and storage assets in exchange for a minimum fee. Future minimum revenues the Partnership expects to receive under these non-cancelable arrangements as of December 31, 2020 are as follows: 2021 - $20,333; 2022 - $13,692; 2023 - $13,297; 2024 - $13,297; 2025 - $12,908; subsequent years - $38,539.\nNOTE 11. INVESTMENT IN WTLPG\nAs discussed in Note 5, on July 31, 2018, the Partnership completed the sale of its 20% non-operating interest in WTLPG. Prior to the sale, the Partnership owned a 19.8% limited partnership and 0.2% general partnership interest in WTLPG. A wholly-owned subsidiary of ONEOK is the operator of the assets. WTLPG owns an approximate 2,300 mile common-carrier pipeline system that primarily transports NGLs from New Mexico and Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation. The Partnership accounted for its ownership interest in WTLPG under the equity method of accounting.\nSelected financial information for WTLPG during the period of ownership is as follows:\nNOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Partnership uses a valuation framework based upon inputs that market participants use in pricing certain assets and liabilities. These inputs are classified into two categories: observable inputs and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs represent the Partnership's own market assumptions. Unobservable inputs are used only if observable inputs are unavailable or not reasonably available without undue cost and effort. The two types of inputs are further prioritized into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions and are not corroborated by market data.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:\nThe Partnership is required to disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates are set forth below for these financial instruments. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument:\n\u2022Accounts and other receivables, trade and other accounts payable, accrued interest payable, other accrued liabilities, income taxes payable and due from/to affiliates: The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments, and as such these have been excluded from the table below. There is negligible credit risk associated with these instruments.\n\u2022Current and non-current portion of long-term debt: The carrying amount of the revolving credit facility approximates fair value due to the debt having a variable interest rate and is in Level 2. The estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes, 2024 Notes, and 2025 Notes (collectively, the \"senior notes\") is considered Level 2, as the fair value is based upon quoted prices for identical liabilities in markets that are not active.\nNOTE 13. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Partnership\u2019s results of operations could be materially impacted by changes in NGL prices and interest rates. In an effort to manage its exposure to these risks, the Partnership periodically enters into various derivative instruments, including commodity and interest rate hedges. All derivatives and hedging instruments are included on the balance sheet as an asset or a liability measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings. All of the Partnership's derivatives are non-hedge derivatives and therefore all changes in fair values are recognized as gains and losses in the earnings of the periods in which they occur.\n(a) Commodity Derivative Instruments\nThe Partnership from time to time has used derivatives to manage the risk of commodity price fluctuation. Commodity risk is the adverse effect on the value of a liability or future purchase that results from a change in commodity price. The Partnership has established a hedging policy and monitors and manages the commodity market risk associated with potential commodity risk exposure. In addition, the Partnership has focused on utilizing counterparties for these transactions whose financial condition is appropriate for the credit risk involved in each specific transaction. The Partnership has entered into hedging transactions as of December 31, 2020 to protect a portion of its commodity price risk exposure. These hedging arrangements are in the form of swaps for NGLs. The Partnership has instruments totaling a gross notional quantity of 137,000 barrels settling during the period from January 31, 2021 through February 28, 2021. At December 31, 2019, the Partnership had instruments totaling a gross notional quantity of 452,000 barrels settling during the period from January 31, 2020 through February 29, 2020. These instruments settle against the applicable pricing source for each grade and location.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\n(b) Tabular Presentation of Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments\nThe following table summarizes the fair values and classification of the Partnership\u2019s derivative instruments in its Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nEffect of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Statement of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\nNOTE 14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nAs of December 31, 2020, Martin Resource Management Corporation owned 6,114,532 of the Partnership\u2019s common units representing approximately 15.7% of the Partnership\u2019s outstanding limited partnership units. Martin Resource Management Corporation controls the Partnership's general partner by virtue of its 51% voting interest in Holdings, the sole member of the Partnership's general partner. The Partnership\u2019s general partner, MMGP, owns a 2% general partner interest in the Partnership and the Partnership\u2019s incentive distribution rights. The Partnership\u2019s general partner\u2019s ability, as general partner, to manage and operate the Partnership, and Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s ownership as of December 31, 2020 of approximately 15.7% of the Partnership\u2019s outstanding limited partnership units, effectively gives Martin Resource Management Corporation the ability to veto some of the Partnership\u2019s actions and to control the Partnership\u2019s management.\nThe following is a description of the Partnership\u2019s material related party agreements:\nOmnibus Agreement\nOmnibus Agreement. The Partnership and its general partner are parties to the Omnibus Agreement dated November 1, 2002, with Martin Resource Management Corporation that governs, among other things, potential competition and indemnification obligations among the parties to the agreement, related party transactions, the provision of general administration and support services by Martin Resource Management Corporation and the Partnership\u2019s use of certain Martin Resource Management Corporation trade names and trademarks. The Omnibus Agreement was amended on November 25, 2009, to include processing crude oil into finished products including naphthenic lubricants, distillates, asphalt and other intermediate cuts.

Under the Omnibus Agreement, Martin Resource Management Corporation provides the Partnership with corporate staff, support services, and administrative services necessary to operate the Partnership\u2019s business. The Omnibus Agreement requires the Partnership to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for all direct expenses it incurs or payments it makes on the Partnership\u2019s behalf or in connection with the operation of the Partnership\u2019s business. There is no monetary limitation on the amount the Partnership is required to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for direct expenses. In addition to the direct expenses, under the Omnibus Agreement, the Partnership is required to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for indirect general and administrative and corporate overhead expenses.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nEffective January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, the board of directors of our general partner approved an annual reimbursement amount for indirect expenses of $16,410. The Partnership reimbursed Martin Resource Management Corporation for $16,410, $16,657 and $16,416 of indirect expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The board of directors of our general partner will review and approve future adjustments in the reimbursement amount for indirect expenses, if any, annually.\nThese indirect expenses are intended to cover the centralized corporate functions Martin Resource Management Corporation provides to the Partnership, such as accounting, treasury, clerical, engineering, legal, billing, information technology, administration of insurance, general office expenses and employee benefit plans and other general corporate overhead functions the Partnership shares with Martin Resource Management Corporation retained businesses. The provisions of the Omnibus Agreement regarding Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s services will terminate if Martin Resource Management Corporation ceases to control the general partner of the Partnership.\nRelated Party Transactions. The Omnibus Agreement prohibits the Partnership from entering into any material agreement with Martin Resource Management Corporation without the prior approval of the Conflicts Committee. For purposes of the Omnibus Agreement, the term \"material agreements\" means any agreement between the Partnership and Martin Resource Management Corporation that requires aggregate annual payments in excess of the then-applicable agreed upon reimbursable amount of indirect general and administrative expenses. Please read \"Services\" above.\nLicense Provisions. Under the Omnibus Agreement, Martin Resource Management Corporation has granted the Partnership a nontransferable, nonexclusive, royalty-free right and license to use certain of its trade names and marks, as well as the trade names and marks used by some of its affiliates.\nAmendment and Termination. The Omnibus Agreement may be amended by written agreement of the parties; provided, however, that it may not be amended without the approval of the Conflicts Committee if such amendment would adversely affect the unitholders. The Omnibus Agreement was first amended on November 25, 2009, to permit the Partnership to provide refining services to Martin Resource Management Corporation. The Omnibus Agreement was amended further on October 1, 2012, to permit the Partnership to provide certain lubricant packaging products and services to Martin Resource Management Corporation. Such amendments were approved by the Conflicts Committee. The Omnibus Agreement, other than the indemnification provisions and the provisions limiting the amount for which the Partnership will reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for general and administrative services performed on its behalf, will terminate if the Partnership is no longer an affiliate of Martin Resource Management Corporation.\nMaster Transportation Services Agreement\nMaster Transportation Services Agreement. MTI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, is a party to a master transportation services agreement effective January 1, 2019, with certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Martin Resource Management Corporation. Under the agreement, MTI agreed to transport Martin Resource Management Corporation's petroleum products and by-products.\nTerm and Pricing. The agreement will continue unless either party terminates the agreement by giving at least 30 days' written notice to the other party. These rates are subject to any adjustments which are mutually agreed upon or in accordance with a price index.

Effective January 1, 2016, the Partnership entered into a second amended and restated terminalling services agreement under which the Partnership provides terminal services to Martin Resource Management Corporation for marine fuel distribution. At such time, the per-gallon throughput fee the Partnership charged under this agreement was increased when compared to the previous agreement and may be adjusted annually based on a price index. This agreement was further amended on January 1, 2017, October 1, 2017, April 1, 2019, and January 1, 2020 to modify its minimum throughput requirements and throughput fees. The term of this agreement is currently evergreen and it will continue on a month to month basis until terminated by either party by giving 60 days\u2019 written notice.\nMiscellaneous Terminal Services Agreements. The Partnership is currently party to several terminal services agreements and from time to time the Partnership may enter into other terminal service agreements for the purpose of providing terminal services to related parties. Individually, each of these agreements is immaterial but when considered in the aggregate they could be deemed material. These agreements are throughput based with a minimum volume commitment. Generally, the fees due under these agreements are adjusted annually based on a price index.\nMarine Agreements\nMarine Transportation Agreement. The Partnership is a party to a marine transportation agreement effective January 1, 2006, as amended, under which the Partnership provides marine transportation services to Martin Resource Management Corporation on a spot-contract basis at applicable market rates. Effective each January 1, this agreement automatically renews for consecutive one year periods unless either party terminates the agreement by giving written notice to the other party at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the then applicable term.

The Partnership is a party to an agreement with Martin Resource Management Corporation dated November 1, 2002 under which Martin Resource Management Corporation provides the Partnership with marine fuel from its locations in the Gulf of Mexico at a fixed rate in excess of a price index. Under this agreement, the Partnership agreed to purchase all of its marine fuel requirements that occur in the areas serviced by Martin Resource Management Corporation.\nOther Agreements\nCross Tolling Agreement. The Partnership is a party to an amended and restated tolling agreement with Cross Oil Refining and Marketing, Inc. (\"Cross\") dated October 28, 2014, under which the Partnership processes crude oil into finished products, including naphthenic lubricants, distillates, asphalt and other intermediate cuts for Cross. The tolling agreement expires November 25, 2031. Under this tolling agreement, Cross agreed to process a minimum of 6,500 barrels per day of crude oil at the facility at a fixed price per barrel. Any additional barrels are processed at a modified price per barrel. In addition, Cross agreed to pay a monthly reservation fee and a periodic fuel surcharge fee based on certain parameters specified in the tolling agreement. Further, certain capital improvements, to the extent requested by Cross, are reimbursed through a capital recovery fee. As of December 31, 2019, the annual capital recovery fee reimbursement of $2,088 expired. An additional $2,586 of capital recovery fee reimbursement expired on December 31, 2020. All of these fees (other than the fuel surcharge and capital recovery fee) are subject to escalation annually based upon the greater of 3% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index for a specified annual period.

LONG-TERM DEBT\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, long-term debt consisted of the following:\n1 Interest rate fluctuates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin set on the date of each advance. The margin above LIBOR is set every three months. Indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin or the base prime rate plus an applicable margin. All amounts outstanding at December 31, 2020 were at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.75%, with LIBOR having a floor of 1.0% per annum in accordance with the July 8, 2020 amendment to the Partnership's revolving credit facility described in further detail below. At December 31, 2020 the applicable margin for revolving loans are LIBOR loans ranges from 2.75% to 4.00% and the applicable margin for revolving loans that are base prime rate loans ranges from 1.75% to 3.00%. The credit facility contains various covenants which limit the Partnership\u2019s ability to make distributions; make certain investments and acquisitions; enter into certain agreements; incur indebtedness; sell assets; and make certain amendments to the Partnership's omnibus agreement with Martin Resource Management Corporation (the \"Omnibus Agreement\").\n2 The Partnership is in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2020.\n3 The indentures for each of the outstanding senior notes restrict the Partnership\u2019s ability to sell assets; pay distributions or repurchase units or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; make investments; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred units; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.\n4 On August 12, 2020 (the \"Settlement Date\"), the Partnership and Martin Midstream Finance Corp. (collectively, the \"Issuers\") completed an exchange offer (the \"Exchange Offer\") and consent solicitation to certain eligible holders of the 2021 Notes and separate but related cash tender offer (the \"Cash Tender Offer\" and, together with the Exchange Offer, the \"Offers\") and consent solicitation to certain other holders of the 2021 Notes.\nPursuant to the Exchange Offer, in exchange for $334,441 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, representing approximately 91.76% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the Issuers (i) paid $41,967 in cash, plus $11,854 of accrued and unpaid interest from and including February 15, 2020 until the Settlement Date, (ii) issued $291,970 in aggregate principal amount of the Issuers\u2019 11.50% senior secured second lien notes due 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\"),\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nand (iii) pursuant to the rights offering in connection with the Exchange Offer, issued $53,750 aggregate principal amount of the Issuers\u2019 10.00% senior secured 1.5 lien notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\"), which amount includes the previously disclosed $3,750 backstop commitment fee which was paid in 2024 Notes.\nPursuant to the Cash Tender Offer, in exchange for $1,225 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, representing approximately 0.34% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, the Issuers paid $791 in cash, plus $43 of accrued and unpaid interest on such existing 2021 Notes from February 15, 2020 up to, but not including, the Settlement Date.\nWhether a debt exchange should be accounted for pursuant to ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors, or pursuant to ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, requires judgments to be made with respect to whether or not an entity is experiencing financial difficulty and if a concession was granted by the creditor. As it was determined that the Partnership did not experience a decrease in the effective borrowing rate of the Partnership\u2019s restructured debt when compared to the Partnership\u2019s existing debt, a concession was not provided and the accounting for troubled debt restructuring was not applied. Further, the Partnership applied the provisions of ASC 470-50 in determining whether to account for the debt exchange as a modification or extinguishment and concluded the debt instruments were not substantially different. Accordingly, the Partnership accounted for the debt exchange as a modification. In conjunction with the transactions above, the Partnership recorded a loss on the Exchange Offer in the amount of $8,817, which includes $9,566 in transaction costs related to the Exchange Offer, plus $189 in net unamortized issuance costs and premiums related to the 2021 Notes, offset by a gain on retirement of the 2021 Notes of $938. In accordance with ASC 470-50 related to debt modifications, the Partnership capitalized certain lender related costs of $5,883 (including the backstop commitment fee described above), which was allocated between the respective senior note issuances and will be amortized over the contractual terms of the 2025 Notes and 2024 Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the remaining portion of the 2021 Notes were due within twelve months and have therefore been presented as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020. On February 15, 2021, the 2021 Notes matured and the Partnership retired the outstanding balance of $28,790 using its revolving credit facility.\n5 In March 2020, the Partnership repurchased on the open market an aggregate $9,344 of the 2021 Notes, resulting in a gain on retirement of $3,484.\n6 Amendment to Credit Facility. On July 8, 2020, the Partnership amended its revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility Amendment\") to, among other things, permit the Exchange Offer. On August 12, 2020, upon the closing of the Exchange Offer and Cash Tender Offer and satisfaction of certain other conditions set forth in the Credit Facility Amendment, the Credit Facility Amendment, among other things:\n\u2022reduced the aggregate amount of commitments under the revolving credit facility from $400 million to $300 million;\n\u2022requires an additional $25 million reduction in the commitments under the revolving credit facility if the Partnership receives $25 million or more in net cash proceeds from any asset sale;\n\u2022limits the Partnership\u2019s ability to make quarterly distributions to its unitholders in excess of $0.005 per unit unless the Partnership\u2019s Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility Amendment) is below 3.75:1:00;\n\u2022increases the pricing under the revolving credit facility and adds a 1.0% LIBOR floor;\n\u2022requires the Partnership to maintain a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of 2.0:1.0 with respect to the fiscal quarters ending in September and December of 2020, 1.75:1.0 with respect to each fiscal quarter ending in 2021, and 2.0:1.0 with respect to each fiscal quarter thereafter;\n\u2022requires the Partnership to maintain a maximum Total Leverage Ratio of not more than 5.75:1.0 with respect to the fiscal quarters ending in September and December of 2020 and March and June of 2021, 5.50 with respect to the fiscal quarter ending in September of 2021, 5.00 with respect to the fiscal quarter ending in December of 2021 and the fiscal quarters ending in March, June and September of 2022, and 4.50:1.0 with respect to each fiscal quarter thereafter, which financial covenant replaces the existing maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility in effect prior to the Credit Facility Amendment);\n\u2022requires the Partnership to maintain a maximum First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility Amendment) of not more than 2.25:1.0 with respect to the fiscal quarters ending in September and December of 2020\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nand each fiscal quarter ending in 2021, and 2.0:1.0 with respect to each fiscal quarter thereafter, which financial covenant replaces the existing maximum Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility in effect prior to the Credit Facility Amendment).\nIn conjunction with the Credit Facility Amendment, the Partnership expensed $1,063 in unamortized debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility for the year ended December 31, 2020, the amount of which is included in \"Interest expense\" in the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Partnership paid cash interest, net of capitalized interest, in the amount of $37,678, $48,025, and $50,543 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capitalized interest was $43, $5, and $624 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNOTE 17. PARTNERS' CAPITAL (DEFICIT)\nAs of December 31, 2020, partners\u2019 capital consisted of 38,851,174 common limited partner units, representing a 98% partnership interest, and a 2% general partner interest. Martin Resource Management Corporation, through subsidiaries, owned 6,114,532 of the Partnership's common limited partnership units representing approximately 15.7% of the Partnership's outstanding common limited partnership units. MMGP, the Partnership's general partner, owns the 2% general partnership interest.\nThe Partnership Agreement contains specific provisions for the allocation of net income and losses to each of the partners for purposes of maintaining their respective partner capital accounts.\nIncentive Distribution Rights\nMMGP holds a 2% general partner interest and certain incentive distribution rights (\"IDRs\") in the Partnership. IDRs are a separate class of non-voting limited partner interest that may be transferred or sold by the general partner under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, and represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributions after the minimum quarterly distribution and any cumulative arrearages on common units once certain target distribution levels have been achieved. The Partnership is required to distribute all of its available cash from operating surplus, as defined in the Partnership Agreement.\nThe target distribution levels entitle the general partner to receive 2% of quarterly cash distributions up to $0.55 per unit, 15% of quarterly cash distributions in excess of $0.55 per unit until all unitholders have received $0.625 per unit, 25% of quarterly cash distributions in excess of $0.625 per unit until all unitholders have received $0.75 per unit and 50% of quarterly cash distributions in excess of $0.75 per unit.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the general partner was allocated no incentive distributions.\nDistributions of Available Cash\nThe Partnership distributes all of its available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) within 45 days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to the general partner. Available cash is generally defined as all cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership on hand at the end of each quarter less the amount of cash reserves its general partner determines in its reasonable discretion is necessary or appropriate to: (i) provide for the proper conduct of the Partnership\u2019s business; (ii) comply with applicable law, any debt instruments or other agreements; or (iii) provide funds for distributions to unitholders and the general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters, plus all cash on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter.\nNet Income per Unit\nThe Partnership follows the provisions of the FASB ASC 260-10 related to earnings per share, which addresses the application of the two-class method in determining income per unit for master limited partnerships having multiple classes of securities that may participate in partnership distributions accounted for as equity distributions. Undistributed earnings are allocated to the general partner and limited partners utilizing the contractual terms of the Partnership Agreement. Distributions to the general partner pursuant to the IDRs are limited to available cash that will be distributed as defined in the Partnership\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nAgreement. Accordingly, the Partnership does not allocate undistributed earnings to the general partner for the IDRs because the general partner's share of available cash is the maximum amount that the general partner would be contractually entitled to receive if all earnings for the period were distributed. When current period distributions are in excess of earnings, the excess distributions for the period are to be allocated to the general partner and limited partners based on their respective sharing of losses specified in the Partnership Agreement. Additionally, as required under FASB ASC 260-10-45-61A, unvested share-based payments that entitle employees to receive non-forfeitable distributions are considered participating securities, as defined in FASB ASC 260-10-20, for earnings per unit calculations.\nFor purposes of computing diluted net income per unit, the Partnership uses the more dilutive of the two-class and if-converted methods. Under the if-converted method, the weighted-average number of subordinated units outstanding for the period is added to the weighted-average number of common units outstanding for purposes of computing basic net income per unit and the resulting amount is compared to the diluted net income per unit computed using the two-class method. The following is a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations and net income from discontinued operations allocated to the general partner and limited partners for purposes of calculating net income attributable to limited partners per unit:\nThe Partnership allocates the general partner's share of earnings between continuing and discontinued operations as a proportion of net income from continuing and discontinued operations to total net income.\nThe following are the unit amounts used to compute the basic and diluted earnings per limited partner unit for the periods presented:\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nAll outstanding units were included in the computation of diluted earnings per unit and weighted based on the number of days such units were outstanding during the period presented. All common unit equivalents were antidilutive for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 because the limited partners were allocated a net loss in this period.\nNOTE 18. UNIT BASED AWARDS\nThe Partnership recognizes compensation cost related to unit-based awards to both employees and non-employees in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with certain provisions of ASC 718. Amounts recognized in selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated financial statements with respect to these plans are as follows:\nAll of the Partnership's outstanding awards at December 31, 2020 met the criteria to be treated under equity classification.\nLong-Term Incentive Plans\nThe Partnership's general partner has a long-term incentive plan for employees and directors of the general partner and its affiliates who perform services for the Partnership.\nOn May 26, 2017, the unitholders of the Partnership approved the Martin Midstream Partners L.P. 2017 Restricted Unit Plan. The plan currently permits the grant of awards covering an aggregate of 3,000,000 common units, all of which can be awarded in the form of restricted units. The plan is administered by the compensation committee of the general partner\u2019s board of directors (the \"Compensation Committee\").\nA restricted unit is a unit that is granted to grantees with certain vesting restrictions, which may be time-based and/or performance-based. Once these restrictions lapse, the grantee is entitled to full ownership of the unit without restrictions. The Compensation Committee may determine to make grants under the plan containing such terms as the Compensation Committee shall determine under the plan. With respect to time-based restricted units (\"TBRU's\"), the Compensation Committee will determine the time period over which restricted units granted to employees and directors will vest. The Compensation Committee may also award a percentage of restricted units with vesting requirements based upon the achievement of specified pre-established performance targets (\"Performance Based Restricted Units\" or \"PBRU's\"). The performance targets may include, but are not limited to, the following: revenue and income measures, cash flow measures, net income before interest expense and income tax expense (\"EBIT\"), net income before interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), distribution coverage metrics, expense measures, liquidity measures, market measures, corporate sustainability metrics, and other measures related to acquisitions, dispositions, operational objectives and succession planning objectives. PBRU's are earned only upon our achievement of an objective performance measure for the performance period. PBRU's which vest are payable in common units. Unvested units granted under the 2017 LTIP may or may not participate in cash distributions depending on the terms of each individual award agreement.\nThe restricted units issued to directors generally vest in equal annual installments over a four-year period.\nOn February 12, 2020, the Partnership issued 27,000 TBRU's to each of the Partnership's three independent directors under the 2017 LTIP. These restricted common units vest in equal installments of 6,750 units on January 24, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.\nOn March 1, 2018, the Partnership issued 301,550 TBRU's and 317,925 PBRU's to certain employees of Martin Resource Management Corporation. The TBRU's vest in equal installments over a three-year service period. The PBRU's will vest at the conclusion of a three-year performance period based on certain performance targets. In addition, the PBRU's awarded on March 1, 2018 that are achieved will only vest if the grantee is employed by Martin Resource Management\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nCorporation on March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership is unable to ascertain if certain performance conditions will be achieved and, as such, has not recognized compensation expense for the vesting of the units. The Partnership will record compensation expense for the vested portion of the units once the achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable.\nThe restricted units are valued at their fair value at the date of grant which is equal to the market value of common units on such date. A summary of the restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 is provided below:\nA summary of the restricted units\u2019 aggregate intrinsic value (market value at vesting date) and fair value of units vested (market value at date of grant) during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is provided below:\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $527 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested time-based restricted units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.53 years.\nNOTE 19. INCOME TAXES\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) from operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nThe operations of a partnership are generally not subject to income taxes, except for Texas margin tax, because its income is taxed directly to its partners. The Texas margin tax is considered a state income tax and is included in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Since the tax base on the Texas margin tax is derived from an income-based measure, the margin tax is construed as income tax, and therefore, the recognition of deferred taxes applies to the margin\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\ntax. The impact on deferred taxes as a result of this provision is immaterial. State income taxes attributable to the Texas margin tax relating to the operation of the Partnership of $468, $458 and $369 were recorded in income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nMTI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, is subject to income taxes due to its corporate structure (\u201cTaxable Subsidiary\u201d). Prior to the acquisition of MTI on January 2, 2019, MTI was a QSub of Martin Resource Management Corporation, a qualifying S Corporation. A QSub is not treated as a separate corporation for federal income tax purposes as it is deemed liquidated into its S Corporation parent. S Corporations are generally not subject to income taxes because income and losses flow through to shareholders and are reported on their individual returns. State income taxes attributable to the preacquisition QSub of $0 were recorded in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. The principal component of the difference between the expected state tax expense and actual state tax expense relates to taxes incurred in states that do not recognize S corporation status.\nSubsequent to the acquisition, the QSub election terminated resulting in MTI being taxed as a stand-alone C Corporation. Total income tax expense relating to the operation of the Taxable Subsidiary of $1,268 and $1,442 was recorded in income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe income tax expense from the Taxable Subsidiary operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 differs from the \"expected\" tax expense (computed by applying the federal corporate rate of 21% to income before income taxes of the Taxable Subsidiary) as follows:\nCash paid for income taxes was $416, $515 and $431 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred taxes are the result of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nDeferred tax assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability and a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the ability to carryback operating losses to prior periods and the expected future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected taxable income, and tax-planning strategies. On the basis of these considerations, as of December 31, 2020, management believes it is more likely than not that the Taxable Subsidiary will realize the benefit of the existing deferred tax assets.\n\"Income taxes payable\" includes a state income tax liability related to the operation of the Partnership of $455 and $298 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Also included in \"Income taxes payable\" is a federal income tax liability related to the operation of the Taxable Subsidiary of $0 and $174 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and state income tax liabilities related to the operation of the Taxable Subsidiary of $101 for the year ended December 31, 2020. State income taxes refundable related to the operation of the Taxable Subsidiary of $117 for the year ended December 31, 2019 are included in \"Other current assets\".\nAt December 31, 2020, MTI had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $80,093 related to federal and state taxes. Of these net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $22,469 will expire between 2027 and 2040 and approximately $57,624 may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe operations of the Partnership are generally not subject to income taxes, except as discussed above, because its income is taxed directly to its partners. The net tax basis in the Partnership's assets and liabilities is greater (less) than the reported amounts on the financial statements by approximately $88,526 and $78,649 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the tax years that remain open to assessment are 2017-2019.\nNOTE 20. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe Partnership has four reportable segments: terminalling and storage, natural gas liquids, transportation, and sulfur services. The Partnership\u2019s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. The operating income of these segments is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and make business decisions.\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 2. The Partnership evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating income. There is no allocation of administrative expenses or interest expense.\nRevenues from one customer in the Natural Gas Liquids segment was $74,722, $112,280 and $148,103 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Partnership's assets by reportable segment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nNOTE 21. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nConsolidated Quarterly Income Statement Information\nNOTE 22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Partnership is subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Partnership.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Partnership received a demand from a customer in its lubricants packaging business for defense and indemnity in connection with lawsuits filed against it in various United States District Courts, which generally allege that the customer engaged in unlawful and deceptive business practices in connection with its marketing and advertising of its private label motor oil. The Partnership disputes that it has any obligation to defend or indemnify the customer for its conduct. Accordingly, on January 7, 2016, the Partnership filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee requesting a judicial determination that the Partnership does not owe the customer the demanded defense and indemnity obligations. The lawsuits against the customer have been transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri for consolidated pretrial proceedings. On March 1, 2017, at the request of the parties, the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee administratively closed the Partnership's lawsuit pending rulings in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. In the event that either party moves the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee to reopen the case, we expect the Court would grant such motion and reopen the case. Further, the same customer has made a claim under the Partnership\u2019s insurance policy. The insurer has denied the claim. However, in the event that the customer is successful in pursuing the claim, such action would negatively impact the Partnership because the Partnership may have certain reimbursement obligations it would owe the insurance company. If the\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\ncase is reopened or the insurance claim by the customer is successful, we are currently unable to determine the exposure we may have in this matter, if any.\nNOTE 23. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe Partnership's operations are conducted by its operating subsidiaries as it has no independent assets or operations. Martin Operating Partnership L.P. (the \"Operating Partnership\"), the Partnership\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, and the Partnership's other operating subsidiaries have issued in the past, and may issue in the future, unconditional guarantees of senior or subordinated debt securities of the Partnership. The guarantees that have been issued are full, irrevocable and unconditional and joint and several. In addition, the Operating Partnership may also issue senior or subordinated debt securities which, if issued, will be fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by the Partnership. Substantially all of the Partnership's operating subsidiaries are subsidiary guarantors of its outstanding senior notes and any subsidiaries other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor.\nNOTE 24. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nRetirement of 2021 Notes. On February 15, 2021, the 2021 Notes matured and the Partnership retired the outstanding balance of $28,790 using its revolving credit facility.\nQuarterly Distribution. On January 25, 2021, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.005 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2020, or $0.02 per common unit on an annualized basis, which was paid on February 12, 2021 to unitholders of record as of February 5, 2021.\nItem 9.",

    "section_9A": "Item 9A.Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our general partner, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our general partner concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Partnership\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n(b) Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our general partner, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.",

In making these determinations, the directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director's business and personal activities as they may relate to us and our management.\nBoard Meetings and Committees\nFrom January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, the board of directors of our general partner held 14 meetings. In 2020, all directors of our general partner attended at least 75% of the meetings of the board of directors and the committees on which they served.

The board of directors of our general partner appoints the members of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Conflicts Committees. Each member of the Audit Committee is an independent director in accordance with NASDAQ and applicable securities laws. Each of the board committees has a written charter approved by the board. Copies of each charter are posted on our website at www.MMLP.com under the \"Corporate Governance\" section. The current members of the committees, the number of meetings held by each committee from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and a brief description of the functions performed by each committee are set forth below:\nConflicts Committee (1 meeting). The members of the Conflicts Committee are: Messrs. Kelley (chairman), Massey and Collingsworth. All of the members of the Conflicts Committee attended all meetings of the committee for the period noted above. The primary responsibility of the Conflicts Committee is to review matters that the directors believe may involve conflicts of interest. The Conflicts Committee determines if the resolution of the conflict of interest is fair and reasonable to us. The members of the Conflicts Committee may not be officers or employees of our general partner or directors, officers, or employees of its affiliates and must meet the independence standards to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors established by NASDAQ. Any matters approved by the Conflicts Committee will be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to us, approved by all of our partners, and not a breach by our general partner of any duties it may owe us or our unitholders.\nAudit Committee (5 meetings). The members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Massey (chairman), Kelley and Collingsworth. All of the members attended all meetings of the Audit Committee for the period noted. The primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to assist the board of directors in its general oversight of our financial reporting, internal controls and audit functions, and it is directly responsible for the appointment, retention, compensation and oversight of the work of our independent auditors. The members of the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner each qualify as \"independent\" under standards established by the SEC for members of audit committees, and the Audit Committee includes at least one member who is determined by the board of directors to meet the qualifications of an \"audit committee financial expert\" in accordance with SEC rules, including that the person meets the relevant definition of an \"independent\" director. C. Scott Massey is the independent director who has been determined to be an audit committee financial expert. Unitholders should understand that this designation is a disclosure requirement of the SEC related to Mr. Massey's experience and understanding with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters. The designation does not impose on Mr. Massey any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than are generally imposed on him as a member of the Audit Committee and board of directors, and his designation as an audit committee financial expert pursuant to this SEC requirement does not affect the duties, obligations or liability of any other member of the Audit Committee or board of directors.\nCompensation Committee (3 meetings). The members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Collingsworth (chairman), Massey and Kelley. All members attended the meeting of the Compensation Committee for the period noted above. The primary responsibility of the Compensation Committee is to oversee compensation decisions for the outside directors of our general partner and executive officers of our general partner (in the event they are to be paid by our general partner) as well as our long-term incentive plan.\nNominating Committee (1 meeting).

The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct incorporate guidelines designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. They also incorporate our expectations of our general partner's employees (including any employees of Martin Resource Management Corporation who undertake actions with respect to us or on our behalf) that enable us to provide accurate and timely disclosure in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other public communications. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is publicly available on our website under the \"Corporate Governance\" section (at www.MMLP.com). This website address is intended to be an inactive, textual reference only, and none of the material on this website is part of this report. If any substantive amendments are made to the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct or if we or our general partner grant any waiver, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the code to any of our general partner's executive officers and directors, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on that website or in a report on Form 8-K.\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nBackground\nWe are required to provide information regarding the compensation program in place as of December 31, 2020, for the CEO, CFO and the three other most highly-compensated executive officers of our general partner as reflected in the summary compensation table set forth below (the \"Named Executive Officers\"). This section should be read in conjunction with the detailed tables and narrative descriptions regarding compensation below.\nWe are a master limited partnership and have no employees. We are managed by the executive officers of our general partner. These executive officers are employed by Martin Resource Management Corporation, a private corporation that has significant operations that are separate from ours. With the exception of our President and Chief Executive Officer as of January 1, 2021, the executive officers of our general partner are also the executive officers of Martin Resource Management Corporation and devote significant time to the management of Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s operations. We reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for a portion of the indirect general and administrative expenses, including compensation expense relating to the service of these individuals that are allocated to us pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement. Under the Omnibus Agreement, we are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for indirect general and administrative and corporate overhead expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the board of directors of our general partner approved reimbursement amounts of $16.4 million, $16.7 million and $16.4 million, respectively, reflecting our allocable share of such expenses. Please see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Agreements - Omnibus Agreement\" for a discussion of the Omnibus Agreement.\nCompensation Objectives\nAs we do not directly compensate the executive officers of our general partner, we do not have any set compensation programs. The elements of Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s compensation program discussed below, along with Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s other rewards, are intended to provide a total rewards package designed to yield competitive total cash compensation, drive performance and reward contributions in support of the businesses of Martin Resource Management Corporation and other Martin Resource Management Corporation affiliates, including us, for which the Named Executive Officers perform services. Although we bear an allocated portion of Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s costs of providing compensation and benefits to the Named Executive Officers, we do not have control over such costs and do not establish or direct the compensation policies or practices of Martin Resource Management Corporation. During 2020, Martin Resource Management Corporation paid compensation based on the performance of Martin Resource Management Corporation but did not set any specific performance-based criteria and did not have any other specific performance-based objectives.\nElements of Compensation\nMartin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s executive officer compensation package includes a combination of annual cash, long-term incentive compensation and other compensation. Elements of compensation which the Named Executive Officers may be eligible to receive from Martin Resource Management Corporation consist of the following: (1) annual base salary; (2) discretionary annual cash awards; (3) awards pursuant to the Martin Midstream Partners L.P. 2017 Restricted Unit Plan and Martin Resource Management Corporation employee benefit plans and (4) where appropriate, other compensation, including limited perquisites.\nAnnual Base Salary. Base salary is intended to provide fixed compensation to the Named Executive Officers for their performance of core duties with respect to Martin Resource Management Corporation and its affiliates, including us, and to compensate for experience levels, scope of responsibility and future potential. Base salaries are not intended to compensate individuals for extraordinary performance or for above average company performance. The base salaries of the Named Executive Officers are generally reviewed on an annual basis, as well as at the time of promotion and other changes in responsibilities or market conditions.\nDiscretionary Annual Cash Awards. In addition to the annual base salary, the Named Executive Officers may be eligible to receive discretionary annual cash awards that, if awarded, are paid in a lump sum in the quarter following the end of the fiscal year. These cash awards are designed to provide the Named Executive Officers with competitive incentives to help\ndrive performance and promote achievement of Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s business objectives. Named Executive Officers may also be eligible to receive a cash award based upon their services provided to us in the event that any such Named Executive Officer has devoted a significant amount of their time to working for us. Any such award is determined in accordance with the same methodologies as the discretionary annual cash awards for Martin Resource Management Corporation, as described below.\nEmployee Benefit Plan Awards. The Named Executive Officers may be eligible to receive awards pursuant to the Martin Midstream Partners L.P. 2017 Restricted Unit Plan and Martin Resource Management Corporation employee benefit plans. These employee benefit plan awards are designed to reward the performance of the Named Executive Officers by providing annual incentive opportunities tied to the annual performance of Martin Resource Management Corporation. In particular, these awards are provided to the Named Executive Officers in order to provide competitive incentives to these executives who can significantly impact performance and promote achievement of the business objectives of Martin Resource Management Corporation.\nOther Compensation. Martin Resource Management Corporation generally does not pay for perquisites for any of the Named Executive Officers, other than general recreational activities at certain Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s properties and use of Martin Resource Management Corporation vehicles, including aircraft. No perquisites are paid for services rendered to us. Martin Resource Management Corporation provides an executive life insurance policy and long term disability policy for the Named Executive Officers with the annual premiums being paid by Martin Resource Management Corporation. Martin Resource Management Corporation does not provide any greater allocation toward employee health insurance premiums than is provided for all other employees covered on the health benefits plan.\nCompensation Methodology\nThe compensation policies and philosophy of Martin Resource Management Corporation govern the types and amount of compensation granted to each of the Named Executive Officers. The board of directors of our general partner has responsibility for evaluating and determining the reasonableness of the total amount we are charged under the Omnibus Agreement for managerial, administrative and operational support, including compensation of the Named Executive Officers, provided by Martin Resource Management Corporation.\nOur allocation for the costs incurred by Martin Resource Management Corporation in providing compensation and benefits to its employees who serve as the Named Executive Officers is governed by the Omnibus Agreement. In general, this allocation is based upon estimates of the relative amounts of time that these employees devote to the business and affairs of our general partner and to the business and affairs of Martin Resource Management Corporation.\nWhen setting compensation for the Named Executive Officers, the elements of compensation above are considered holistically to provide an appropriate combination of compensation. Annual base salaries for the Named Executive Officers, other than our President and Chief Executive Officer as of January 1, 2021, are determined by the Management Compensation Committee of Martin Resource Management Corporation comprised of its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ruben Martin, Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Randall Tauscher, and Vice President-Human Resources, Mrs. Melanie Mathews (collectively, the \"Management Compensation Committee of Martin Resource Management Corporation\") based on a periodic performance review of each Named Executive Officer. As of January 1, 2021, the Compensation Committee of our board of directors will be responsible for setting the compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer. Except in the case of an exceptional amount of time devoted to us, discretionary annual cash awards are based on the performance of Martin Resource Management Corporation. Annual discretionary cash awards, if any, are calculated first by allocating a portion of Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s earnings as determined by the Management Compensation Committee of Martin Resource Management Corporation for distribution to key employees of Martin Resource Management Corporation. Upon such allocation, the Management Compensation Committee of Martin Resource Management Corporation, with input from appropriate business leaders determines the allocation and distribution of the bonus pool among such employees, including the Named Executive Officers. All decisions of the Management Compensation Committee of Martin Resource Management Corporation concerning the compensation of the Named Executive Officers are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Martin Resource Management Corporation, which is made up of Mr. Cullen M. Godfrey, an independent director of Martin Resource Management Corporation and Mr. Ruben Martin. With respect to employee benefit plan awards pursuant to plans maintained by the Partnership, the Management Compensation Committee of Martin Resource Management Corporation makes a recommendation as to whether such awards should be awarded to any employees. Any such employee plan awards are then considered and must be approved by the Compensation Committee and then are distributed to the employees, including Named Executive Officers, accordingly. Further, Martin Resource Management Corporation, with the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Martin Resource Management Corporation or the Compensation Committee regularly reviews market data and relevant compensation surveys\nwhen setting base compensation and, when appropriate, engages compensation consultants. Because he serves on both the Management Compensation Committee of Martin Resource Management Corporation and on the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Martin Resource Management Corporation, Mr. Martin, as Chief Executive Officer of Martin Resource Management Corporation, has significant authority in setting base salaries, discretionary annual cash award allocations and amounts and employee benefit award distributions.\nAny awards granted under our long-term incentive plan, which to date have consisted of the grant of restricted common units to the independent directors and employees of our general partner, are approved by the Compensation Committee.\nDetermination of 2020 Compensation Amounts\nDuring 2020, elements of all compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers by Martin Resource Management Corporation consisted of the following: (1) annual base salary; (2) discretionary annual cash awards; (3) awards pursuant to the Martin Midstream Partners L.P. 2017 Restricted Unit Plan and Martin Resource Management Corporation employee benefit plans; and (4) other compensation, including limited perquisites. With respect to the Named Executive Officers, they were paid an allocated portion of their base salaries.\nAnnual Base Salary. The portions of the annual base salaries paid by Martin Resource Management Corporation to the Named Executive Officers, which are allocable to us under our Omnibus Agreement with Martin Resource Management Corporation, are reflected in the summary compensation table below. Based upon the agreement of our general partner with Martin Resource Management Corporation, we have reimbursed Martin Resource Management Corporation for approximately 70.2% of the aggregate annual base salaries paid to the Named Executive Officers by Martin Resource Management Corporation during 2020. The foregoing agreement has been developed based on an assessment of the estimated percentage of the time spent by the Named Executive Officers managing our affairs, relative to the affairs of Martin Resource Management Corporation ranging from approximately 55% to 100%. During 2020, our Named Executive Officers were Mr. Ruben Martin, the President and Chief Executive Officer of our general partner, Mr. Robert Bondurant, an Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of our general partner, Mr. Randall Tauscher, an Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our general partner, Mr. Chris Booth, the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of our general partner, and Mr. Scot A. Shoup, Senior Vice President of Operations. As of December 31, 2020 Ruben Martin retired and ceased being a Named Executive Officer and Robert D. Bondurant was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer. Sharon L. Taylor became Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and a Named Executive Officer.\nDiscretionary Annual Cash Awards. Discretionary annual cash awards paid to the Named Executive Officers which are allocable to us are reflected in the summary compensation table below.\nMartin Midstream Partners L.P. Long-Term Incentive Plan\nOn May 26, 2017, the unitholders of the Partnership approved the Martin Midstream Partners L.P. 2017 Restricted Unit Plan (the \"2017 LTIP\"). The plan currently permits the grant of awards covering an aggregate of 3,000,000 common units, all of which can be awarded in the form of restricted units. The plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our general partner\u2019s board of directors. The purpose of the 2017 LTIP is designed to enhance our ability to attract, retain, reward and motivate the services of certain key employees, officers, and directors of the general partner and Martin Resource Management Corporation.\nOur general partner\u2019s board of directors or the Compensation Committee, in their discretion, may terminate or amend the 2017 LTIP at any time with respect to any units for which a grant has not yet been made. Our general partner\u2019s board of directors or the Compensation Committee also have the right to alter or amend the 2017 LTIP or any part of the plan from time to time, including increasing the number of units that may be reserved for issuance under the plan subject to any applicable unitholder approval. However, no change in any outstanding grant may be made that would materially impair the rights of the participant without the consent of the participant. In addition, the restricted units will vest upon a change of control of us, our general partner or Martin Resource Management Corporation or if our general partner ceases to be an affiliate of Martin Resource Management Corporation.\nRestricted Units. A restricted unit is a unit that is granted to grantees with certain vesting restrictions, which may be time-based and/or performance-based. Once these restrictions lapse, the grantee is entitled to full ownership of the unit without restrictions. The Compensation Committee may determine to make grants under the plan containing such terms as the Compensation Committee shall determine under the plan. With respect to time-based restricted units (\"TBRU's\"), the Compensation Committee will determine the time period over which restricted units granted to employees and directors will\nvest. The Compensation Committee may also award a percentage of restricted units with vesting requirements based upon the achievement of specified pre-established performance targets (\"Performance Based Restricted Units\" or \"PBRU's\"). The performance targets may include, but are not limited to, the following: revenue and income measures, cash flow measures, EBIT, EBITDA, distribution coverage metrics, expense measures, liquidity measures, market measures, corporate sustainability metrics, and other measures related to acquisitions, dispositions, operational objectives and succession planning objectives. PBRU's are earned only upon our achievement of an objective performance measure for the performance period. PBRU's which vest are payable in common units. The Compensation Committee believes this type of incentive award strengthens the tie between each grantee's pay and our financial performance. We intend the issuance of the common units upon vesting of the restricted units under the plan to serve as a means of incentive compensation for performance and not primarily as an opportunity to participate in the equity appreciation of the common units. Therefore, plan participants will not pay any consideration for the common units they receive, and we will receive no remuneration for the units. Unvested units granted under the 2017 LTIP may or may not participate in cash distributions depending on the terms of each individual award agreement.\nIf a grantee\u2019s service to the Partnership terminates for any reason, the grantee\u2019s restricted units will be automatically forfeited unless, and to the extent, the Compensation Committee provides otherwise. Common units to be delivered upon the vesting of restricted units may be common units acquired by our general partner in the open market, common units already owned by our general partner, common units acquired by our general partner directly from us or any affiliate of our general partner, newly issued common units under the LTIP, or any combination of the foregoing. Our general partner will be entitled to reimbursement by us for the cost incurred in acquiring common units. If we issue new common units upon vesting of the restricted units, the total number of common units outstanding will increase.\nMartin Resource Management Corporation Employee Benefit Plans\nMartin Resource Management Corporation has employee benefit plans for its employees who perform services for us. The following summary of these plans is not complete but outlines the material provisions of these plans.\nMartin Resource Management Corporation Purchase Plan for Units of Martin Midstream Partners L.P. Martin Resource Management Corporation maintains a purchase plan for our units to provide employees of Martin Resource Management Corporation and its affiliates who perform services for us the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in us through the purchase of our common units. Each individual employed by Martin Resource Management Corporation or an affiliate of Martin Resource Management Corporation that provides services to us is eligible to participate in the purchase plan. Enrollment in the purchase plan by an eligible employee will constitute a grant by Martin Resource Management Corporation to the employee of the right to purchase common units under the purchase plan. The right to purchase common units granted by the Partnership under the purchase plan is for the term of a purchase period.\nDuring each purchase period, each participating employee may elect to make contributions to his bookkeeping account each pay period in an amount not less than one percent of his compensation and not more than fifteen percent of his compensation. The rate of contribution shall be designated by the employee at the time of enrollment. On each purchase date (the last day of such purchase period), units will be purchased for each participating employee at the fair market value of such units. The fair market value of the common units to be purchased during such purchase period shall mean the closing sales price of a unit on the purchase date.\nMartin Resource Management Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plans.\nMRMC Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\"). Martin Resource Management Corporation maintains an employee stock ownership plan that covers employees who satisfy certain minimum age and service requirements. Under the terms of the ESOP, Martin Resource Management Corporation has the discretion to make contributions in an amount determined by its board of directors. Those contributions are allocated under the terms of the ESOP and invested primarily in the common stock of Martin Resource Management Corporation. Participants in the ESOP become 100% vested upon completing six years of vesting service or upon their attainment of Normal Retirement Age (as defined in the plan document), permanent disability or death during employment. Any forfeitures of non-vested accounts may be used to pay administrative expenses and restore previous forfeitures of employees rehired before incurring five consecutive breaks-in-service. Any remaining forfeitures will be allocated to the accounts of employed participants. Participants are not permitted to make contributions including rollover contributions to the ESOP.\nMartin Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the \"Plan\"). Martin Resource Management Corporation maintains an employee stock ownership plan that covers employees who satisfied certain minimum age and service requirements but no employee shall become eligible to participate in the Plan on or after January 1, 2013. This Plan is referred to as the \"Martin\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan\". Under the terms of the Plan, Martin Resource Management Corporation has the discretion to make contributions in an amount determined by its board of directors. Those contributions are allocated under the terms of the Plan and invested primarily in the common stock of Martin Resource Management Corporation. No contributions will be made to the Plan for any Plan year commencing on or after January 1, 2013. The account balances of any participant who was employed by Martin Resource Management Corporation on December 31, 2012 are fully vested and non-forfeitable. The Plan converted to an employee stock ownership plan on January 1, 2013.\nMartin Resource Management Corporation 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan. Martin Resource Management Corporation maintains a profit sharing plan that covers employees who satisfy certain minimum age and service requirements. This profit sharing plan is referred to as the \"401(k) Plan.\" Eligible employees may elect to participate in the 401(k) Plan by electing pre-tax contributions up to 30% of their regular compensation. Martin Resource Management Corporation may make annual discretionary profit sharing contributions in an amount at the plan year end as determined by the board of directors of Martin Resource Management Corporation. Participants in the 401(k) Plan prior to January 1, 2017 are 100% vested in matching contributions, while those employed after January 1, 2017 become vested upon completion of the five years of vesting service schedule or upon their attainment of age 65, permanent disability or death during employment. The five year vesting service schedule is also applicable to discretionary contributions made to the plan.\nMartin Resource Management Corporation Non-Qualified Option Plan. In September 1999, Martin Resource Management Corporation adopted a stock option plan designed to retain and attract qualified management personnel, directors and consultants. Under the plan, Martin Resource Management Corporation is authorized to issue to qualifying parties from time to time options to purchase up to 2,000 shares of its common stock with terms not to exceed ten years from the date of grant and at exercise prices generally not less than fair market value on the date of grant. In November 2007, Martin Resource Management Corporation adopted an additional stock option plan designed to retain and attract qualified management personnel, directors and consultants. In December 2013, all outstanding options were exercised or redeemed in lieu of redemption. There are no outstanding options under this plan as of December 31, 2020.\nChange of Compensation Policy. As of January 1, 2021, the Compensation Committee of our general partner will be solely responsible for determining the base salary, bonus compensation, long-term incentive compensation and other compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee will be responsible for the development of the compensation objectives and methodology applicable to the President and Chief Executive Officer.\nOther Compensation\nMartin Resource Management Corporation generally does not pay for perquisites for any of our named executive officers other than general recreational activities at certain Martin Resource Management Corporation\u2019s properties located in Texas and use of Martin Resource Management Corporation vehicles, including aircraft.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nThe following table sets forth the compensation expense that was allocated to us for the services of the named executive officers for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n(1) The amounts shown represent the grant date fair value of awards computed in accordance with FASB ASC 718, however, such awards are subject to vesting requirements for TBRU's and PBRU's which have not been met as it relates to the 2018 stock award. See Note 18 included in Item 8 herein for the assumptions made in our valuation of such awards.\nDirector Compensation\nAs a partnership, we are managed by our general partner. The board of directors of our general partner performs for us the functions of a board of directors of a business corporation. Directors of our general partner are entitled to receive total quarterly retainer fees of $16,250 each, which are paid by the general partner. Martin Resource Management Corporation employees who are a member of the board of directors of our general partner do not receive any additional compensation for serving in such capacity. Officers of our general partner who also serve as directors will not receive additional compensation. All directors of our general partner are entitled to reimbursement for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with their travel to and from, and attendance at, meetings of the board of directors or committees thereof.
