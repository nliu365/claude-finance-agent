(the \u201cCompany\u201d), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 1, 2007, as Fairytale Ventures, Inc., and later changed its name to Aviation Surveillance Systems, Inc. and Harmonic Energy, Inc. On January 23, 2017, the Company changed its name to THC Therapeutics, Inc. On January 17, 2018, the Company changed its name to Millennium Blockchain Inc. On September 28, 2018, the Company changed its name back to THC Therapeutics, Inc. THC Therapeutics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is collectively referred to herein as the \u201cCompany,\u201d and \u201cTHC Therapeutics.\u201d\nThe Company is focused on developing a sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator\u00ae, which has been specifically designed for the drying and sanitizing (i.e., reducing the bacterial count) of freshly harvested cannabis, and other herbs, flowers, and tea leaves.\nCorporate History\nTHC Therapeutics, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 1, 2007, as Fairytale Ventures, Inc., as a development stage company with plans to provide products and services related to themed children\u2019s parties, and later changed its name to Aviation Surveillance Systems, Inc., when the Company shifted its business plan to focus on merging with an operating firm, and Harmonic Energy, Inc., when the Company shifted its plan of operations again, instead focusing on oil and gas operations.\nOn January 23, 2017, the Company experienced a change of control, and new management determined to shift the Company\u2019s focus and changed the Company\u2019s name to THC Therapeutics, Inc., focusing on wellness operations and development of a herb dryer for use with cannabis. On May 30, 2017, the Company formed Genesis Float Spa LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, to market its float spa assets purchased for wellness centers. On January 17, 2018, the Company changed its name to Millennium BlockChain Inc. and began to also focus on acquiring digital equity or digital assets of blockchain technology companies. On September 28, 2018, because of the regulatory environment surrounding blockchain technology companies, the Company changed its name back to THC Therapeutics, Inc., abandoned its blockchain technology focus, and refocused its efforts on its wellness operations.\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year end is July 31st, its telephone number is (702) 602-8422, and the address of its principal executive office is 11700 W Charleston Blvd. #73, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89135.\nDescription of Business\nThe Company is focused on operations in the wellness industry. The Company is developing a sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator\u00ae, with multiple design, function, and usage patents. This innovative, laboratory-proven product is specifically designed for the drying and sanitizing (i.e., reducing the bacterial count by using ultraviolet light) of freshly harvested cannabis, and other herbs, flowers, and tea leaves. The dHydronator\u00ae can reduce moisture content of cannabis to 10-15% in only 10-14 hours. Traditional herbal drying times can take up to two weeks. Additionally, after the Company has launched the dHydronator\u00ae, and depending on available funding, the Company intends to establish a float spa facility that will allow each guest to customize their wellness experience, at their own pace, based on their individual needs.\nEffective November 20, 2017, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with ADVFN plc of the United Kingdom (\u201cADVFN\u201d) to create a joint venture entity, MJAC InvestorsHub International Conferences Limited, to be owned 50/50 by the Company and ADVFN. Effective April 1, 2018, the Company and ADVFN terminated the joint venture agreement.\nPreviously, the Company had also been focused on seeking partnerships and investments in the blockchain technology industry, and making strategic investments in the equity of target companies and their tokens. In September of 2018, the Company assessed the current regulatory environment regarding cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, as well as the progress of the Company\u2019s 20 separate patent claims for the Company\u2019s sanitizing herb dryer, and the Company determined that it would refocus its efforts on developing the Company\u2019s dHydronator sanitizing herb dryer.\nWellness Operations\nTHC Therapeutics is focused on the wellness industry, with plans to develop a patented herb dryer as well as an innovative float spa facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, or southern California.\nThe Company is developing a sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator\u00ae, with multiple design, function, and usage patents. This innovative, laboratory-proven1 product is specifically designed for the drying and sanitizing (i.e., reducing the bacterial count by using ultraviolet light) of freshly harvested cannabis, and other herbs, flowers, and tea leaves. The dHydronator\u00ae can reduce moisture content of cannabis to 10-15% in only 10-14 hours. Traditional herbal drying times can take up to two weeks. The dHydronator\u00ae can also significantly reduce the bacterial count of the cannabis during the drying process, but it will not eliminate all bacteria from the cannabis or other plant materials.\nThe Company has a functioning prototype of the dHydronator\u00ae similar in design to that shown below, which is now protected by a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (see \u201cPatent, Trademark, License & Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations & Concessions\u201d below), and once the Company has sufficient funds available, the Company plans to source parts for serial manufacturing and negotiate and secure serial manufacturing and assembly. The Company also plans to hire sales and marketing staff as funds are available.\n________________\n1 Tests were conducted in 2016-2017 by independent cannabis-testing labs: first by CannLabs on the first-generation dHydronator\u00ae prototype, and later by Digipath Labs on the second-generation prototype. Optimal cannabis moisture content is 8-12%. The initial testing by CannLabs showed that (i) moisture content across five wet cannabis samples was reduced to an average moisture content of 13.81% with a standard deviation of 4.04% after 12 hours of drying, and 8.86% with a standard deviation of 2.25% after 16 hours of drying, and (ii) after autoclaving cannabis flowers to ensure sterility and then spiking multiple samples with 100 CFU of E. Coli and Salmonella bacteria and Aspergillus niger mold, testing for the presence of the bacteria and mold by both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and traditional plating methods, which testing concluded that the dHydronator\u00ae prototype eliminated or reduced the bacteria and mold contamination, but did not quantify the results. The subsequent testing by Digipath Labs on the second-generation prototype covered multiple strains and independent tests to confirm the prior findings. The strains tested were Lucy Diamond, Cotton Candy, Blue Dream, Kings Cut, Pot of Gold and Diablo. The optimal drying time was determined to be 10-14 hours in the first test. The Company\u2019s proprietary sanitizing technology brought the failing TAC (total aerobic count) from over 300,000 CFU/g down to 78,000 CFU/g (anything less than 100,000 CFU/g is considered \u201cpassing\u201d) in the second test. In the third test, after drying 14 hours and 15.5 hours in the dHydronator\u00ae and using the Company\u2019s proprietary sanitizing technology for a longer period than required, the moisture content had been reduced from 80% (at 0 hours) to 10.89% (at 14 hours) and 8.83% (at 15.5 hours), the THCA% had been reduced from 21.2% (at 0 hours) to 17.26% (at 14 hours) and 18.26% (at 15.5 hours), and the TAC had been reduced from 210,000 CFU/g (at 0 hours) to 1,500 CFU/g (at 14 hours) and 500 CFU/g (at 15.5 hours). In the fourth experiment, after 12 hours and 15.5 hours of drying in the dHydronator\u00ae and using the proprietary sanitizing technology for a longer period than required, the moisture content had reduced from 80% to 12.00% (at 12 hours) and 7.44% (at 15.5 hours), the THCA% had been reduced from 21.2% to 20.08% (at 12 hours) and 19.43% (at 15.5 hours), and the TAC had been reduced from 190,000 CFU/g to 51,000 CFU/g (at 12 hours) and 2,300 CFU/g (at 15.5 hours). After 14 hours of drying, the moisture content had been reduced to 8.15%, the THCA% had been reduced to 19.82%, and the TAC had been reduced to 21,000 CFU/g. In the fifth test, prior moisture and THCA% results were tested, but this time using the Company\u2019s proprietary sanitizing technology for a much shorter time period, using two samples of a different cannabis strain, and testing the expanded cannabinoid profile data of each sample, and after 12 hours of drying two different samples, moisture content for the two samples decreased from 74% and 74% to 9.17% and 9.90%, respectively, and THCA% increased from 14.45% and 14.94% before drying to 16.81% and 17.2%, respectively, after 12 hours of drying. Test six was a test of the same strain as test five but using a different lot of plant material, and moisture content decreased from 81% to 11.5% after 12 hours of drying, while TCHA% increased from 21.28% to 22.6% after 12 hours of drying. The seventh through ninth tests confirmed prior results.\nMore specifically, once we have at least $2,000,000 in in available cash flow or funds from other operations and if we receive the patent, we intend to engage in further development efforts as follows: (i) finalizing case design, with an estimated tooling expense of approximately $300,000-$500,000; manufacturing pre-production units for field testing and presentation to potential partners and distributors, with an estimated expense of $250,000; (iii) hiring a subject-matter expert and consultants or employees in the home herb garden and legal cannabis marketplace to manage the development and sales of herb dryer, with an estimated expense of $400,000 for 12 months; (iv) engaging in further detailed laboratory of our herb drying with respect to cannabis plants and home herb garden plants, with an estimated expense of $50,000 to $100,000 for 12 months; (v) establishing a relationship with a market research and/or marketing company to explore creative strategies, advertising concepts, and consumer opinion, explore applications of our intellectual property in the existing wholesale and retail distribution channels for home herb, garden products and legal cannabis markets, and determine the best path for sales, distribution and licensing of our intellectual property, with an estimated expense of $1,000,000 for 12 months.\nAdditionally, on May 12, 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party under which it acquired four (4) float spa units and associated equipment. With the acquisition of these assets, the Company intends to establish a float spa facility that will allow each guest to customize their wellness experience, at their own pace, based on their individual needs. Once we have approximately $500,000-$1,000,000 in available cash flow or funds from other operations, and after the launch of our dHydronator\u00ae sanitizing herb dryer, we plan to capitalize on our spa assets purchased in 2017 by (i) leasing a 2,500 to 5,000 square foot facility in Nevada or California, to be built out as needed (and with the size of the facility dependent on available capital); (ii) obtaining necessary licenses and permits, (iii) purchasing inventory, equipment, furnishings and supplies, including inventory, fixtures, furnishings and equipment for an oxygen bar and a Kampuchea, juice and tea Bar, refrigeration and storage equipment, point of sale computers and tablets, digital monitors, signage and display materials, and other suppliers; (iv) hiring spa management personnel including a manager, assistant manager and two spa attendants; (v) hiring marketing and sales consultants, and (vi) launching a marketing campaign to include internet lead services, Groupon and social networking.\nThe Company previously focused on acquiring equity or tokens of blockchain technology companies (each a \u201cTarget Company\u201d). During calendar 2018, the Company issued shares of its common stock and preferred stock to three Target Companies (see \u201cBurstIQ\u201d, \u201cImpactPPA\u201d, and \u201cRobot Cache\u201d below) in exchange for rights to digital tokens and/or equity purchase rights in the Target Companies. We did not receive any tokens or equity of any of the Target Companies, and we have now rescinded our agreements with each of the Target Companies.\nBurstIQ\nBurstIQ Analytics Corporation (\u201cBurstIQ\u201d) is a healthcare data company. We previously issued 500,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to BurstIQ in consideration of the Company\u2019s right to acquire tokens and preferred stock of BurstIQ. On May 3, 2019, we rescinded our acquisition agreements with BurstIQ, and BurstIQ agreed to return 500,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to the Company for cancellation.\nImpactPPA\nImpactPPA Limited (\u201cImpactPPA\u201d) has designed an Ethereum-based decentralized energy platform to potentially transform the global energy finance industry. We previously issued 6,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock to ImpactPPA in consideration of the Company\u2019s right to acquire tokens of ImpactPPA. On June 26, 2019, we rescinded our acquisition agreement with ImpactPPA, and ImpactPPA agreed to return 6,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock to the Company for cancellation.\nRobot Cache\nRobot Cache, S.L. (\u201cRobot Cache\u201d) is the first decentralized PC video game distribution platform with a revolutionary digital resale model designed to utilize blockchain technology. We previously issued 600,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, and warrants to acquire additional common stock, to Robot Cache in consideration of the Company\u2019s right to acquire tokens of Robot Cache. On June 26, 2019, we rescinded our acquisition agreements with Robot Cache, and Robot Cache agreed to return 600,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to the Company for cancellation.\nAs we will never receive any tokens or equity of any of these blockchain-related companies, we do not believe that federal, state, local or foreign regulations affecting blockchain technologies and digital assets (for example, money transmission laws) will have any affect on our business.\nCompetition\nThere are a number of commercial herb dryers sold by competitors, including Yofumo Technologies, which are already commercially available, and which have significant market share. As to our float spa plans, we believe True Rest Float Spa, which has over 20 spa locations across the country, is our primary national competitor, and there are numerous locally owned float spas throughout the country that would considered competitors with our spa operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with any of these competitors.\nMarket Opportunity\nThe Company\u2019s herb dryer, the dHydronator\u00ae, safely lowers moisture content and sanitizes without harm to the integrity of the plant. Our test results have been proven to dry cannabis in less than 14 hours verses up to 14 days using traditional drying methods. Test results indicate the removal of many surface germs and bacteria including powder mold, dust mites and spider mites from herbs, plants, the surface of glass or ceramic herbal tea accessories, and any other object that fits safely in the drying chamber. Therefore, we believe that our product will be attractive to the cannabis and home herb and garden product markets.\nWith regard to floatation therapy, the sensory deprivation consumer typically ranges in age from eighteen to eighty. Floatation therapy is a service that is unisex in its appeal and attracts many. As many consumers seek natural alternative therapies for the relief from pain, stress and sleep disorders that affect a significant percentage of the population, we believe that our planned floatation therapy spa facilities will be attractive to these consumers.\nMarketing Strategy\nWe plan to attend regional cannabis-related trade shows and offer field testing to legal cannabis growers and suppliers in the United States and Canada initially, and throughout the world once the technology has been adopted in the regional market. We also plan to establish a relationship with a market research and marketing company to explore creative strategies, advertising concepts, consumer opinion, existing distribution and sales channels and potential licensing of our intellectual property, to determine the best path for sales and distribution. We also intend to hire subject matter expert consultants or employees in the legal cannabis and home herb marketplace to manage the development and sales of our products. Once our marketing experts identify an herbal or commercial agriculture niche or venue to enter or solicit, we will market to distributors and retailers via trade shows and direct contact.\nWith regard to our spa plans, we intend to launch internet, Groupon and social networking campaigns offering coupons and membership plans for floatation therapy, and our planned oxygen bar and Kampuchea, juice and tea bar. We plan to invite local TV and Radio personalities to tour our facilities, and we plan to offer local healthcare and rehabilitation service providers and non-competitive spa owners and managers a private tour of our spa facilities.\nCustomers\nDue to the nature of its business and its focus on development of its patent-pending herb dryer, the Company does not currently have any customers.\nPatent, Trademark, License & Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations & Concessions\nThe Company has acquired the exclusive intellectual property rights to the dHydronator\u00ae sanitizing plant dryer with improved convection flow from the Company\u2019s CEO and Director, Brandon Romanek. Mr. Romanek\u2019s father irrevocably assigned those intellectual property rights to Mr. Romanek in 2016. A trademark application for the mark \u201cdHyrdonator\u201d has been filed (serial no. 86874611), and a patent application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), docket number 5503.101 (application nos. 15/467,722 and 62/312,327), for 20 separate herb dryer design, function, and usage patents. On or about July 20, 2018, the Company\u2019s patent counsel received a Notification of Allowance from the USPTO, notifying the Company that the USPTO would be allowing all 20 claims, and on or about November 20, 2018, the USPTO granted the final patent (patent no. 10,132,56), the Company was subsequently notified of the patent grant, and the patent has been recorded with the USPTO as being assigned to the Company.\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe will be governed by government laws and regulations governing spas. We do not believe the dHydronator\u00ae will be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other government agency (other than pursuant to general laws governing truth in advertising or similar laws under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission). We believe that we are currently in compliance with all laws which govern our operations and have no current liabilities thereunder. Our intent is to maintain strict compliance with all relevant laws, rules and regulations.\nEmployees\nThe Company currently has one full-time employee, our founder, CEO and director, Brandon Romanek, and one other employee.\nReports to Security Holders\nThe Company intends to furnish its stockholders with annual reports containing consolidated financial statements audited by its independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited consolidated financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. The Company files Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet its timely and continuous disclosure requirements. The Company may also file additional documents with the Commission if those documents become necessary in the course of its operations.\nThe public may read and copy any materials that the Company files with the SEC at the SEC\u2019s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The site address is www.sec.gov.\nAvailable Information\nAll reports of the Company filed with the SEC are available free of charge through the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, the public may read and copy materials filed by the Company at the SEC\u2019s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may also obtain additional information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330.\nItem 1A.",
    "section_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company, as a smaller reporting company (as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), is not required to furnish information required by this item. However, the following important factors among others, could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time.\nThere are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern\nWe have not generated any revenues or profit during the years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019. We expect that our operating expenses will increase over the next twelve months to continue our development activities. Based on our average monthly expenses and current burn rate, we estimate that our cash on hand will not sufficiently support our operation for the next twelve months. If we cannot raise the money that we need in order to continue to operate our business, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations. If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional financing, we may need to curtail, discontinue or cease operations.\nWe have had a history of losses and may incur future losses, which may prevent us from attaining profitability.\nWe have had a history of operating losses since our inception and, as of July 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $34.6 million. We may incur operating losses in the future, and these losses could be substantial and impact our ability to attain profitability. We expect to significantly increase expenditures for product development, general and administrative expenses, and sales and marketing expenses, and there is no guarantee that we will ever generate revenues, or that we ever achieve or sustain profitability or positive operating cash flows. Even if we achieve profitability and positive operating cash flows, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability or positive operating cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis.\nFederal drug regulation and enforcement may adversely impact our operations.\nCurrently, there are approximately 30 states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment, and there are approximately 8 states and the District of Columbia that have more expansive laws legalizing marijuana for recreational use. Conversely, under the Controlled Substances Act (the \u201cCSA\u201d), the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited. Until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical marijuana, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law.\nAs we plan on marketing our herb dryer to the cannabis industry, federal enforcement of federal law would adversely affect the cannabis industry and would therefore adversely affect the Company\u2019s planned operations and sales. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect revenues and profits of the Company.\nOur products may become subject to regulation by the FDA, which would materially increase the costs associated with developing the products.\nWe do not believe our dHydronator\u00ae herb dryer product will be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) or any other government agency (other than pursuant to general laws governing truth in advertising and similar laws under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission). The FDA could disagree and determine that the dHydronator\u00ae is subject to FDA regulation.\nThe process for obtaining regulatory approval to market products regulated by the FDA is expensive, time-consuming, and can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidates involved. Our ability to generate revenues from the sale of the dHydronator\u00ae would be adversely affected if we are delayed because our product is subject to FDA regulation, or if we are unable to successfully develop our products to comply with FDA regulation.\nWe may not be able to achieve our strategic initiatives and grow our business as anticipated.\nBeginning in early 2018, based on the historical experience of our sole officer trading commodities, we made a strategic decision to focus on acquiring crypto-related assets. In September 2018, we determined to focus on our sanitizing herb dryer and floatation spa plans. Our strategic initiatives have required us to devote financial and operational assets to these activities. Our success depends on our ability to appropriately manage our expenses as we execute on our planned initiatives. If we are not able to execute on this strategy successfully, our business may not grow as we anticipate, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have a history of changing and discontinuing operations and have retained obligations associated with discontinued activities.\nWe have changed our name and business plan multiple times since our inception in 2007, and have a history of discontinued operations. We have carried liabilities of approximately $60,580 associated with discontinued operations, and there is no guarantee that we will not change our business plan in the future and discontinue current operations.\nIf we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), because we believe we are covered by the Rule 3a-2 safe harbor promulgated under the Investment Company Act.\nSection 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines the term \u201cinvestment company\u201d to mean any issuer that \u201cis or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities.\u201d Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines \u201cinvestment company\u201d as any issuer which \u201cis engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 per centum of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\u201d Generally, any issuer meeting the definition of an investment company is subject to all applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and must register with the Commission under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act, unless it meets the terms and conditions of various exceptions provided by the Investment Company Act including, but not limited to, those provided in Section 3(c) of the Investment Company Act, or in rules adopted by the SEC under the Investment Company Act.\nRule 3a-2 promulgated by the SEC under the Investment Company Act generally provides that, for purposes of Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, an issuer will not be deemed to be engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities for a period not to exceed one year if the issuer has a bona fide intent to be engaged in a non-investment company business. This rule is intended to enable the issuer to make an orderly transition to a non-investment company business during the one-year safe harbor period.\nWhile we previously acquired rights to equity and digital tokens of other companies, with those rights having a value exceeding 40% of our total assets, we determined in September of 2018 that we would focus our operational efforts on developing and launching our sanitizing herb dryer and would no longer engage in the business of acquiring blockchain-related assets. As of January 31, 2019, all of our rights to equity and digital tokens of other companies had been fully impaired and had nominal value pursuant to the relevant accounting guidance, and in May and June of 2019, we rescinded all of our agreements to acquire rights to equity and digital tokens of other companies. As those agreements have been legally rescinded, it is as if we never acquired any rights to equity or digital tokens. As a result, we believe we were never an \u201cinvestment company\u201d and are covered by the Rule 3a-2 safe harbor.\nHowever, if we were to be deemed an investment company, we would be required to register as an investment company or adjust our business strategy and assets. If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would incur substantial expenses associated with such registration, and we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure, management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons, asset composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property, then our ability to compete could be negatively affected, which would harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have acquired the rights to our sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator\u00ae, from our CEO, Mr. Romanek, and the herb dryer has received patent protection. There is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain the patent in the future.\nWe believe that the market for the dHydronator\u00ae depends to a significant extent upon the goodwill and patent protection afforded by the patent protection covering the dHydronator\u00ae. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The failure to maintain the patent for the dHydronator\u00ae, or the loss or infringement of our patent rights would impair the goodwill associated with the dHydronator\u00ae and harm our reputation, which would harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIf our intellectual property is not adequate to provide us with a competitive advantage or to prevent competitors from replicating our products, or if we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed.\nOur future success and ability to compete in the herb drying market depends upon our ability to produce a sanitizing herb dryer, which we attempt to protect under a combination of patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. However, we have not yet been issued a patent, and even if we are, the legal protections afforded by patent law and contractual proprietary rights in our products provide only limited protection and may be time-consuming and expensive to enforce or maintain. Further, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our proprietary rights or from independently developing non-infringing products that are competitive with, equivalent to or superior to our herb dryer.\nMonitoring infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to detect every infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights. Even if we do detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights, litigation to enforce these rights could cause us to divert financial and other resources away from our business operations. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nAdditionally, third parties may claim that our herb dryer infringes upon their intellectual property rights, and there can be no assurance that one or more of our products will not be found to infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights in the future.\nOur products may be subject to recalls.\nManufacturers and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including product defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If our sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator\u00ae, is recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, we could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. We may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin, or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention and adversely affect our other operations.\nAdditionally, if our herb dryer were subject to recall, the goodwill associated with that product and with us could be harmed. A recall would likely lead to decreased demand for our herb dryer, but it could also materially and adversely effect our spa as well and the perception of our company as a whole. Additionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses. Furthermore, any product recall affecting the cannabis industry more broadly could lead consumers to lose confidence in the safety and security of products sold by other participants in the industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Brandon Romanek, our Chief Executive Officer. Although we have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Romanek providing for certain benefits, including severance in the event of a termination without cause, this agreement does not prevent him from terminating his employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any personnel. The loss of the services of Mr. Romanek could impede the achievement of our herb dryer and spa research, development, commercialization and acquisition objectives.\nIn addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, to assist us in formulating our development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe will need additional funding if we intend on executing our operational plans and making future acquisitions. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our planned development.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities. Furthermore, upon the effectiveness of this Registration Statement, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a mandatory filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our herb dryer and spa development plans.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or other assets.\nUntil the time, if ever, that we can generate substantial product revenues, we plan to finance our cash needs through some combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nBecause we will become a reporting company under the Exchange Act by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering, we may not be able to attract the attention of research analysts at major brokerage firms.\nBecause we will not become a reporting company by conducting an underwritten initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and because we will not be listed on a national securities exchange, security analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our company. In addition, investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite secondary offerings on our behalf than they might if we were to become a public reporting company by means of an IPO because they may be less familiar with our company as a result of more limited coverage by analysts and the media, and because we became public at an early stage in our development.\nOur common stock is subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules, which may make it difficult for broker-dealers to complete customer transactions and could adversely affect trading activity in our securities.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is currently less than $5.00 per share and therefore our stock is considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d according to SEC rules, unless we are listed on a national securities exchange. Under these rules, broker-dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than institutional accredited investors must:\n\u2610\nmake a special written suitability determination for the purchaser;\n\u2610\nreceive the purchaser\u2019s prior written agreement to the transaction;\n\u2610\nprovide the purchaser with risk disclosure documents which identify certain risks associated with investing in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d and which describe the market for these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d as well as a purchaser\u2019s legal remedies; and\n\u2610\nobtain a signed and dated acknowledgment from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has actually received the required risk disclosure document before a transaction in a \u201cpenny stock\u201d can be completed.\nIf required to comply with these rules, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nOur stock price may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u2610\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u2610\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2610\nannouncements about us or about our competitors, including new product introductions and commercial results;\n\u2610\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2610\ndevelopments concerning our licensors or manufacturers;\n\u2610\nlitigation and other developments;\n\u2610\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2610\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; and\n\u2610\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for companies related to the cannabis in any way in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe currently have outstanding shares of preferred stock that have special rights that could limit our ability to undertake corporate transactions, inhibit potential changes of control and reduce the proceeds available to our common stockholders in the event of a change in control.\nWe currently have outstanding two classes of stock, common stock and preferred stock, and there are two series of preferred stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to super voting and super converting rights.\nAs a result of the rights the holder of our Series A Preferred Stock has, we may not be able to undertake certain corporate transactions, including equity or debt offerings necessary to raise sufficient capital to run our business, change of control transactions or other transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our common stockholders might otherwise receive a premium price for their shares. The market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by the rights of our preferred stockholders.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our common stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Under the terms of our existing Articles of Incorporation, we cannot declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any class or series of our capital stock, other than dividends on shares of common stock payable in shares of common stock, unless we pay dividends to the holders of our preferred stock. Additionally, without special stockholder and board approvals, we cannot currently pay or declare dividends and will be limited in our ability to do so until such time, if ever, that we are listed on a stock exchange.\nOur executive officer and director have the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officer and director, Brandon Romanek, holds 2,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock (each share votes as the equivalent of 100 shares of common stock on all matters submitted for a vote by the common stockholders), and as such, he would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, Mr. Romanek would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws and under Nevada law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable (a \u201cCorporate Transaction\u201d), including transactions in which our common stockholders might otherwise receive a premium price for their shares.\nSpecifically, our authorized capital stock in our articles of incorporation includes preferred stock issuable in one or more series. Our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and determine the price, designation, rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and conditions, including voting and dividend rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued. Issuance of preferred stock with preferential voting rights or economic rights, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the voting power of our outstanding voting securities, which could deprive our holders of common stock to purchase common stock at a premium that they might otherwise realize in connection with a proposed acquisition of our company. Similarly, our bylaws generally state that a majority of our board of directors constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and do not require that a larger percentage of our directors constitute a quorum. These provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws effectively mean that a simple majority of our board of directors could, without common shareholder approval, designate a class of preferred stock, and issue shares of that class of preferred stock, in a manner that would discourage, delay or prevent a Corporate Transaction from occurring.\nThese provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public reporting company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public reporting company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a non-reporting company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nWe currently have outstanding, and we may, in the future issue instruments which are convertible into shares of common stock, which will result in additional dilution to you.\nWe currently have outstanding debt and equity instruments which are convertible into shares of common stock, and we may need to issue similar instruments in the future. In the event that these convertible instruments are converted into shares of common stock, or that we make additional issuances of other convertible or exchangeable securities, you could experience additional dilution. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to issue shares or other securities in any offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors or the then-current market price.\nWe cannot predict every event and circumstance that may impact our business and, therefore, the risks discussed herein may not be the only ones you should consider.\nAs we continue to grow our business, we may encounter other risks of which we are not aware as of the date of this Registration Statement. These additional risks may cause serious damage to our business in the future, the impact of which we cannot estimate at this time.\nItem 1B.",

The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market System, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, that:\n\u00b7\ncontains a description of the nature and level of risks in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;\n\u00b7\ncontains a description of the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities\u2019 laws; contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;\n\u00b7\ncontains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;\n\u00b7\ndefines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and\n\u00b7\ncontains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation.\nThe broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with:\n\u00b7\nbid and offer quotations for the penny stock;\n\u00b7\nthe compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;\n\u00b7\nthe number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the marker for such stock; and\n\u00b7\nmonthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules that require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgement of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitably statement.\nThese disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock.\nRelated Stockholder Matters\nNone.\nPurchase of Equity Securities\nNone.\nItem 6.",

You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Form 10-K. Investors should carefully consider all of such risks before making an investment decision with respect to the Company\u2019s stock. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and summary of selected financial data for THC Therapeutics, Inc. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment from our Management.\nPlan of Operation\nTHC Therapeutics is focused on the wellness and nutraceutical industry. The Company is developing a sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator\u00ae, with multiple design, function, and usage patents. This innovative, laboratory-proven product is specifically designed for the drying and sanitizing (i.e., reducing the bacterial count) of freshly harvested cannabis, and other herbs, flowers, and tea leaves. The dHydronator\u00ae can reduce moisture content of cannabis to 10-15% in only 10-14 hours. Traditional herbal drying times can take up to two weeks. The Company also intends to establish a float spa facility that will allow each guest to customize their wellness experience, at their own pace, based on their individual needs.\nThe following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, which are included herein.\nOur financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nOn December 7, 2018, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) announced the Company\u2019s 1:10 reverse stock split of the Company's common stock and preferred stock. The reverse stock split took effect on December 10, 2018. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share information in this registration statement and included in the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, have been adjusted for the stock split as if such stock split occurred on the first day of the first period presented. Certain amounts in the notes to the financial statements may be slightly different than previously reported due to rounding of fractional shares as a result of the reverse stock split.\nGoing Concern Qualification\nSeveral conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $34,626,315 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company\u2019s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the Year Ended July 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur operating results for the year ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:\nRevenues\nWe did not earn any revenues during the years ending July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We do not anticipate earning significant revenues until such time that we have fully developed our investment strategy.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nOur loss from operations decreased by $25,371,500 during the year ended July 31, 2020, from an operating loss of $26,689,910 in the same period in 2019. The following table presents operating expenses for the annual periods in 2020 and 2019:\nWe realized an decrease of $23,269,777 in consulting fees during the year ended July 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation. We realized an increase of $78,846 in general and administrative expenses during the year ended July 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to an increase in marketing costs. We realized a decrease of $2,792,019 in impairment expense during the year ended July 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the impairment of crypto-currency assets.\nWe realized a decrease of $5,444 in depreciation expenses during year ended July 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, due to a decrease in depreciable assets.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe following table presents other income and expenses for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018:\nGain/loss on change in derivative liability increased by $3,986,129 during the year ended July 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, due to change in derivative liabilities caused by fluctuations in the price of our common stock between reporting periods. Gain on settlement of debts decreased by $127,500 during the year ended July 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019due to additional debt settlements occurring during the year ended July 31, 2020. Loss on sale of investment increased by $12,149 during the year ended July 31, 2020 compared to to the same period in 2019, due to an increase in the sale of investments in the current year. Gain on rescission of token agreements decreased by $7,651,981 during the year ended July 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, because the token agreements were rescinded in in 2019 and not 2020. Interest expense increased by $184,114 during the year ended July 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, due to an increases in loans, and convertible notes.\nNet Income (loss)\nNet loss decreased to $1,925,179 during the year ended July 31, 2020, from a net loss of $23,307,064 in the same period 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased upon our current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months. We intend to fund operations through sales of our herb dryer and debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nWorking Capital\nThe following table presents our working capital position as of July 31, 2020, and July 31, 2019:\nThe change in working capital during the year ended July 31, 2020, was primarily due to a decrease in current assets of $274,312 and an increase in current liabilities of $594,569. Current assets decreased due to a decrease in cash and prepaid expenses as of July 31, 2020. Current liabilities increased due to an increase in borrowing, which resulted in convertible notes payable, net of $305,110, advances from related parties of $83,660, convertible notes payable - related party, net of $124,931, derivative liability of $842,573, as compared to convertible notes payable, net of $152,895, advances from related parties of $104,219, convertible notes payable - related party, net of $24,658, derivative liability of $611,265 as of July 31, 2019. Cash decreased as of July 31, 2020, by $274,312 to $43,239, primarily caused by increased cash used in operations during the year ending July 31, 2020.\nCash Flow\nWe fund our operations with cash received from advances from officer\u2019s and related parties, debt, and issuances of equity.\nThe following tables presents our cash flow for the years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe did not generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the year ended July 31, 2020.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2019, net cash flows used in operating activities consisted of a net loss of $1,925,179, reduced by depreciation and amortization of $20,114, stock-based compensation of $438,434,amortization of debt discounts of $426,376,offset by a loss on change in derivative liabilities of $58,080, loss on settlement of debts of $165,000, and increased by a net increase in change of operating assets and liabilities of $357,582.For the years ended July 31, 2019, net cash flows used in operating activities consisted of a net loss of $23,307,064, reduced by depreciation of $23,558, stock-based compensation of $23,822,476,offset by a loss on change in derivative liabilities of $2,918,856, loss on settlement of debts of $37,500, loss on impairment of assets of $2,429,981, and increased by a net increase in change of operating assets and liabilities of $226,858.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nFor the year ended July 31, 2020, no cash flows were used in investing activities. For the year ended July 31, 2019, net cash flows used in investing activities consisted of purchases of purchase of fixed assets of $1,195.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended July 31, 2020, we received $163,499 from convertible notes, we received $128,522 from loans from related party, we received $288,014from loans, and used $149,081 for net repayments on related party debts and $117,333 for net repayments on notes payable. For the year ended July 31, 2019, we received $766,380 from convertible notes, we received $120,153 from loans from related party and used $175,500 for net repayments on related party debts and $65,453 for net repayments on notes payable.\nAnticipated Cash Requirements\nWe estimate that our expenses to further implement our plan of operations over the next 12 months, will be approximately $3,810,000 as described in the table below. These estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our future business activities and our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources. We further anticipate incurring additional costs and expenses for accounting, legal, and other miscellaneous fees relating to compliance with SEC requirements and the filing of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.\nGiven that our cash needs are strongly driven by our growth requirements, we also intend to maintain a reserve sum for other risk contingencies that may arise.\nWe intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through the use of the cash we have on hand and through business operations, future equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We currently do not have any other arrangements in place to complete any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such financings on terms that will be acceptable to us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 3, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\nManagement believes the Company\u2019s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u2019s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures.\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company\u2019s goodwill, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, and the valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments and short-term instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the respective fair values due to the short maturities of these items.\nAs required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).\nRevenue Recognition: We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standard Board\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, which requires that five steps be followed in evaluating revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfied a performance obligation.\nWe did not have a cumulative impact as of January 1, 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606 and there was not an impact to our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 as a result of applying Topic 606.\nThe company has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are collected by the company from its customers (sales and use taxes, value added taxes, some excise taxes).\nProduct Sales - Revenues from the sale of products are recognized when title to the products are transferred to the customer and only when no further contingencies or material performance obligations are warranted, and thereby have earned the right to receive reasonably assured payments for products sold and delivered.\nCosts of Revenue - Costs of revenue includes raw materials, component parts, and shipping supplies. Shipping and handling costs is not a significant portion of the cost of revenue.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - The Company follows Financial Accounting Standard Board\u2019s (FASB) Codification Topic 350-10 (\u201cASC 350-10\u201d), \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d According to this statement, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization, but rather an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair-value based test. Fair value for goodwill is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised values as appropriate. Under ASC 350-10, the carrying value of assets are calculated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.\nLong-Lived Assets - In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounts Standard Codification (ASC) ASC 360-10, \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment,\u201d the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nSegment Reporting - Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company currently has one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes, which represents the Company\u2019s core business.\nIncome Taxes - The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with FASB Codification Topic ASC 740-10, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nStock-Based Compensation - The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 \u201cCompensation-Stock Compensation\u201d, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to an Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the estimated fair values.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share - The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB Codification Topic ASC 260-10 \u201cEarnings Per Share.\u201d Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted earnings (loss) per share has not been presented since the effect of the assumed exercise of options and warrants to purchase common shares (common stock equivalents) would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nSeasonality\nWe do not expect our sales to be impacted by seasonal demands for our products and services.\nItem 7A.",

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and\nBoard of Directors of THC Therapeutics Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of THC Therapeutics Inc.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt About the Company\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s cumulative net losses and wraises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Management\u2019s plans are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis of Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Boyle CPA, LLC\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018\nBayville, NJ\nNovember 4, 2020\n361 Hopedale Drive SE\nP (732) 822-4427\nBayville, NJ 08721\nF (732) 510-0665\nTHC THERAPEUTICS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nTHC THERAPEUTICS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nTHC THERAPEUTICS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nTHC THERAPEUTICS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nTHC THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY\nDescription of business - THC Therapeutics, Inc., (referred to as the \u201cCompany\u201d) is focused developing its patented product, the dHydronator\u00ae, a sanitizing herb dryer. The main function of the dHydronator is to greatly accelerate the drying time of a herb while sanitizing it. The dHydronator can be used to dry a variety of herbs, but it has been specifically tested for use with cannabis, and it can reduce the drying time for cannabis from 10-14 days to less than 14 hours.\nHistory - The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 1, 2007, as Fairytale Ventures, Inc., and later changed its name to Aviation Surveillance Systems, Inc. and Harmonic Energy, Inc. On January 23, 2017, the Company changed its name to THC Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn May 30, 2017, the Company formed Genesis Float Spa LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, to market its float spa assets purchased for wellness centers. The Company\u2019s health spa plans are part of the Company\u2019s strategic focus on revenue generation and creating shareholder value.\nOn January 17, 2018, the Company changed its name to Millennium Blockchain Inc.\nOn September 28, 2018, the Company changed its name back to THC Therapeutics, Inc.\nTHC Therapeutics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, shall herein be collectively referred to as the \u201cCompany.\u201d\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN\nBasis of Presentation - The Company has incurred losses for the past several years while developing infrastructure and its intellectual property. As of July 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $1,820,758. In response to these conditions, the Company plans to raise additional capital through the sale of debt and equity securities.\nGoing Concern - The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $34,626,315 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company\u2019s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic - In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and has since spread worldwide, including to the Unites States, posing public health risks that have reached pandemic proportions (the \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic\u201d). The COVID-19 Pandemic poses a threat to the health and economic wellbeing of our employees, customers and vendors. Like most businesses world-wide, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted the Company financially; however, management cannot presently predict the scope and severity with which COVID-19 will impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES\nThe accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company\u2019s most recent Annual Audited Financial Statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent Annual Audited Financial Statements have been omitted.\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company\u2019s goodwill, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, and the valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments and short-term instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There are $43,239 and $317,551 in cash and no cash equivalents as of July 31, 2020 and July 31, 2019, respectively.\nConcentration Risk - At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. As of July 31, 2020, the cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits was $0. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the respective fair values due to the short maturities of these items.\nAs required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of July 31, 2020:\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of July 31, 2019:\nRevenue Recognition: We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, which requires that five steps be followed in evaluating revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfied a performance obligation.\nThe company has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are collected by the company from its customers (sales and use taxes, value added taxes, some excise taxes).\nRevenues from the sale of products are recognized when title to the products are transferred to the customer and only when no further contingencies or material performance obligations are warranted, and thereby have earned the right to receive reasonably assured payments for products sold and delivered.\nCosts of Revenue - Costs of revenue includes raw materials, component parts, and shipping supplies. Shipping and handling costs is not a significant portion of the cost of revenue.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - The Company follows Financial Accounting Standard Board\u2019s (FASB) Codification Topic 350-10 (\u201cASC 350-10\u201d), \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d According to this statement, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization, but rather an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair-value based test. Fair value for goodwill is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised values as appropriate. Under ASC 350-10, the carrying value of assets are calculated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.\nLong-Lived Assets - In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounts Standard Codification (ASC) ASC 360-10, \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. During the years ending July 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company recorded an impairment expense of $0 and $2,429,981, respectively.\nSegment Reporting - Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company currently has one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes, which represents the Company's core business.\nIncome Taxes - The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with FASB Codification Topic ASC 740-10, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nStock-Based Compensation - The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 \u201cCompensation-Stock Compensation\u201d, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to an Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the estimated fair values.\nStock based compensation expense recognized under ASC 718-10 for the years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled $438,434 and $19,093,205, respectively.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share - The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB Codification Topic ASC 260-10 \u201cEarnings Per Share.\u201d Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted earnings (loss) per share has not been presented since the effect of the assumed exercise of options and warrants to purchase common shares (common stock equivalents) would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nAdvertising Costs - The Company\u2019s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expenses of $54,678 and $28,296 during the years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements -\nASU 2016-02 - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases\", (\"ASC 842\") which amended the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASC 842 is effective for public companies during interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, which permits entities to record the right-of-use asset and lease liability on the date of adoption, with no requirement to recast comparative periods.\nWe adopted ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019 using the optional transition method of recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2019. Therefore, comparative financial information was not adjusted and continues to be reported under the prior lease accounting guidance in ASC 840. We elected the transition relief package of practical expedients, and as a result, we did not assess 1) whether existing or expired contracts contain embedded leases, 2) lease classification for any existing or expired leases, and 3) whether lease origination costs qualified as initial direct costs. We elected the short-term lease practical expedient by establishing an accounting policy to exclude leases with a term of 12 months or less, as well as the land easement practical expedient for maintaining our current accounting policy for existing or expired land easements.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which modifies the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees to largely align it with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2019. Management evaluated ASU 2018-07 and determined that the adoption of this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n4. FIXED ASSETS\nFixed assets consist of the following as of July 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDepreciation expense for the years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, was $15,697 and $21,154, respectively.\n5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets consist of the following as of July 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAmortization expense for the years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, was $4,417 and $4,404 respectively.\n6.

The lease includes all utilities, and the lease term ends March 30, 2021.\n8. SECURED NOTES PAYABLE\n9. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE\nConvertible Notes Payable at consists of the following:\n10. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE RELATED PARTY\nOn May 1, 2019, we entered into a convertible promissory note pursuant to which we borrowed $200,000 from Harvey Romanek, the father of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Brandon Romanek. Interest under the convertible promissory note is 10% per annum, and the principal and all accrued but unpaid interest is due on May 1, 2021. The note is convertible six months after the issuance date at the noteholder\u2019s option into shares of our common stock at a Variable Conversion Price of 65% multiplied by the lowest Trading Price for the Common Stock during the ten (10) Trading Day period ending on the last complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.\nThe Company recorded a debt discount in the amount of $200,000 in connection with the original issuance discount, offering costs and initial valuation of the derivative liability related to the embedded conversion option of the Note to be amortized utilizing the effective interest method of accretion over the term of the Note. The aggregate debt discount has been accreted and charged to interest expenses as a financing expense in the amount of $100,274 during the year ended July 31, 2020.\nFurther, the Company recognized a derivative liability of $387,232 and an initial loss of $187,232 based on the Black-Scholes pricing model.

    "section_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures\u201d to mean the company\u2019s controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer\u2019s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a simple system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objectives of timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports and of ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported with the time periods specified. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of these objectives.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of the CEO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records which in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the issuer; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2020. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of July 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria.\nTo remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures:\n\u00b7\nThe Company plans to add independent directors to its Board and create an audit committee with at least three directors that qualify as \u201cindependent\u201d directors pursuant to relevant NASDAQ or similar exchange rules.\n\u00b7\nThe Company will add sufficient knowledgeable accounting personnel to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements.\n\u00b7\nUpon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and procedures.\nThe additional hiring of accounting personnel and appointment of independent members of the Board is contingent upon the Company\u2019s operational efforts. Management expects to hire additional personnel and staff its audit committee with at additional independent directors in the coming fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able to do so.\nWe understand that remediation of material weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls are a continuing work in progress due to the issuance of new standards and promulgations. However, remediation of any known deficiency is among our highest priorities. Our management will periodically assess the progress and sufficiency of our ongoing initiatives and make adjustments as and when necessary.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management\u2019s report in this annual report. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Included in the Act is a provision that permanently exempts smaller public companies that qualify as either a \u201cNon-Accelerated Filer\u201d or \u201cSmaller Reporting Company\u201d from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2020, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept as set forth above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nThe Company\u2019s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nItem 9B.",

We believe that Mr. Romanek\u2019s financial markets background makes him a valuable member of our Board of Directors.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:\n(1) had a petition under the Federal bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency law filed by or against, or a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer was appointed by a court for the business or property of such person, or any partnership in which he was a general partner at or within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or business association of which he was an executive officer at or within two years before the time of such filing;\n(2) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding or is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);\n(3) has been the subject of any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining him from, or otherwise limiting, the following activities:\n(i) Acting as a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, floor broker, leverage transaction merchant, any other person regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or an associated person of any of the foregoing, or as an investment adviser, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or employee of any investment company, bank, savings and loan association or insurance company, or engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with such activity;\n(ii) Engaging in any type of business practice; or\n(iii) Engaging in any activity in connection with the purchase or sale of any security or commodity or in connection with any violation of Federal or State securities laws or Federal commodities laws;\n(4) has been the subject of any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any Federal or State authority barring, suspending or otherwise limiting for more than 60 days the right of such person to engage in any activity described in (3)(i) above, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;\n(5) has been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated;\n(6) has been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated;\n(7) has been the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:\n(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; or\n(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or\n(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or\n(8) has been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.\nOur Directors are elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, with vacancies filled by the Board of Directors, and serve until their successors are elected and qualified, or their earlier resignation or removal. Officers are appointed by the board of Directors and serve at the discretion of the board of Directors or until their earlier resignation or removal. Any action required can be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation which may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if consent of consents in writing setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office, its principle place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which the proceedings of meetings are recorded.\nIndemnification of Directors and Officers\nNevada law allows for the indemnification of officers, directors, and any corporate agents in terms sufficiently broad to indemnify such persons under certain circumstances for liabilities, including reimbursement for expenses, incurred arising as a result of their service as officers, directors or agents of the Company. The Bylaws of the Company provide that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law and such right to indemnification will continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company and will inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and similar successors; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company will not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred will include the right to be paid by the Company the expenses (including attorney\u2019s fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition.\nThe Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Company similar to those conferred on directors and officers of the Company. Furthermore, the Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another company against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under Nevada law.\nCode of Ethics\nWe intend to adopt a code of ethics that applies to our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, but have not done so to date due to our relatively small size. We intend to adopt a written code of ethics in the near future.\nItem 11.",
